# Failure Cases — the war-stories behind each Do-NOT

Each happened in the live run this skill was distilled from. They are why the rules exist; read them when you doubt whether a rule is worth following.

## 1. "Delete first" was wrong — twice

The first instinct was to delete bloated memory. Then it became "actually, move it". Then "actually, thin it". The correct frame is **migrate / thin / keep / delete**, decided per file by scope. Treating cleanup as "delete the mess" loses both migratable value and legitimate handoffs. Cost: two full reversals before landing on the right model.

## 2. reference + pointer ≠ guaranteed-to-load

The plan was "put the profile in `references/`, point at it from CLAUDE.md — now it's tool-agnostic". Wrong: a plain-text pointer is **on-demand in both tools**; the agent may never open it. The fix was the two-layer split — inline the hardcore into CLAUDE.md body (guaranteed), pointer to the rest. Finding this required actually checking how each tool loads docs, not assuming.

## 3. Codex does not follow text pointers (official-docs-confirmed)

It was assumed Codex would follow "see `~/.claude/references/...`" written inside CLAUDE.md. It does **not** — it only auto-injects the doc files on its directory chain, and treats inline paths as plain text. Verified (2026-06, codex v0.142.3) against Codex's official AGENTS.md docs **and** a real session log. Consequence: the symlink (so the global CLAUDE.md *is* one of those auto-injected files) is load-bearing, and the hardcore must live in that file's body.

## 4. The 32 KiB truncation nobody knew about

Codex's `project_doc_max_bytes` defaults to 32 KiB. A long global CLAUDE.md had its **entire back half silently dropped** in Codex — for however long the user had been running Codex. Only running codex + grepping a back-of-file string revealed it. Fix: raise the limit in `config.toml`, and keep the user-context section near the top regardless.

## 5. Changed the table row, missed the judgment sentence

A governance table's "user preferences → memory" row was updated to "→ references/user/", but the prose "decision method" sentence three lines below still said "→ memory". A row and its surrounding logic drift apart if you only edit the eye-catching one. Rule: after changing one fact, grep/read the **whole section**.

## 6. The hub forgot to index its own child

The hub (`user-profile.md`) was built with an index of 4 children; a 5th child file was created later and never added to the index. From the entry point, the 5th file was unreachable — its whole content effectively invisible. A multi-agent review caught it. Rule: when you add a child, update the hub index in the same breath.

## 7. Deleting would have dangled live links

Before deleting migrated memory, a grep found **surviving** (non-migrating) memory files still `[[linking]]` to them. Deleting first would have left dangling links. Rule: grep cross-references **before** deleting; repoint survivors to the new reference.

## 8. "You can verify it yourself later" — no

After wiring the symlink, the instinct was to tell the user "next time you run Codex, grep the log to confirm". That hands an **agent-doable** verification back to the user. The right move: run codex right now, grep the log, report the proof. Owning the feedback loop is the whole point of the skill.

## 9. (meta) Don't load past-session JSONL into context to "mine history"

When distilling a skill from *prior* sessions, do **not** read the multi-MB transcript JSONL into your own context — it blows the window (one attempt died ~17 tokens over the limit and lost the whole session). Delegate extraction to subagents that parse line-by-line with a script and return only a distilled lessons list. (For this skill the live run was already in-context, so no mining was needed — but the instinct to "just read the history" is the trap.)

## 10. The archive was left inside `memory/`

A soft-delete moved `feedback_*.md` into `memory/archive/2026-07-05/`. Because the memory loader scans the `memory/` tree recursively, those files were still live memory. The fix: move the dated archive to a sibling directory **outside** `memory/` (e.g., `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/.memory-archive-2026-07-05/`) and update the index pointer. Verifying: `grep -R "feedback_" memory/` should only hit the explicit archive pointer or text references, not the archived files.

## 11. "Symlink looks correct" was mistaken for Codex verification

After creating `~/.codex/AGENTS.md → ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, the agent stopped there. Later, a live `codex exec` run revealed the global file was loading, but the verification protocol had hardcoded `"User context"` while the actual inlined section was titled `"用户上下文"`, so the heading grep returned `0`. The fix: run `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check`, extract the session id from the header, find the rollout JSONL, and grep for the **actual** heading string plus a back-half string. Only that empirical check is proof.

## 13. Dangling references were hiding in project docs, not just memory (2026-07-06)

A memory file about the prod cutover was referenced by the project's own `CLAUDE.md` and by a handoff doc in `docs/handoff/`. The cross-reference agent had only been asked to grep the memory directory, so those live-doc pointers would have dangled after archival. The fix: extend the pre-archive grep to **project docs, CLAUDE.md, and handoff docs** — anywhere a memory basename might be cited.

## 14. A real-name identity map almost migrated into project docs (2026-07-06)

`project_user_management_sop.md` contained a table mapping `user3 → <a coworker's real name>` and other real-name-to-system-username pairs. It was project-relevant (useful for ops), but the real names are PII and the mapping is not a team artifact. Migrating it into version-controlled `docs/` would have leaked identifying information. The fix: keep identity-mapping in private memory, thin it to a pointer to the public SOP, and add an explicit privacy check in Phase 1.

## 15. Partial duplicates were overwritten instead of merged (2026-07-06)

Several memory files (`architecture_v2_decision.md`, `cache_regression_2026_04_12.md`, `project_upstream_capture_shipped_2026_05_13.md`) were partial duplicates of existing project docs. The first instinct was to replace the doc with the memory version; that would have lost doc-only updates and formatting. The correct move: diff the two, append the memory's **unique** details to the existing doc, and archive the memory.

## 16. Inventory agents reported "no home" for content a private skill repo already held (2026-09-24, Goal B)

Three sub-agents classified 70 memory files. Their prompts named the global references, the
public skill repo and the project docs, but not the private skill repo. Two entries — a
font-substitution finding and a subtitle toolchain — came back as "needs migration"; both
were already documented in the private repo's skills. The fix: list every search root in the
prompt, public and private, and treat an agent's "no home" as covering only the roots it was
told about.

## 17. A search that searched nothing reported fourteen clean misses (2026-09-24)

A spot-check stored several directories in one shell variable and passed it unquoted. In zsh
that variable does not split into words, so the search tool received one nonexistent path
and every one of fourteen patterns returned nothing. The misses looked exactly like "no
existing home". Running the same command on a string known to exist returned nothing too,
which exposed it. Pass multiple roots as an array (`"${ROOTS[@]}"`) and calibrate each
search shape on a known hit before believing a zero.

## 18. Another session was still writing memory during the migration (2026-09-24, Goal B)

One memory file grew from 11 KB to 26 KB an hour into the migration — a different session in
the same project had appended new material. Two sessions contacted about it had not written
it. Recording each file's hash when it was migrated, and comparing again right before
archiving, is what makes the archive step safe; migrating the latest content first and
archiving last keeps nothing from being lost if a late write lands.
