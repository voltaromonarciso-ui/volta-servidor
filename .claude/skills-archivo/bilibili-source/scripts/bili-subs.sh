# bili-subs.sh — Download a Bilibili video's subtitle/transcript track. REQUIRES LOGIN.
#
# Important, verified 2026-06: Bilibili subtitles are gated behind login. The public
# player API (player/wbi/v2) returns an EMPTY subtitle list for anonymous requests across
# every video tested (new and old), and yt-dlp reports "Subtitles are only available when
# logged in." There is NO login-free path — do not try to bypass it. So this script needs
# the user's Bilibili session, supplied as browser cookies.
#
# Because it reads the user's logged-in session, ASK THE USER before running it.
#
# Usage:
#   bili-subs.sh <BVID | av | URL> [browser]     # browser: chrome (default), firefox, safari, edge
#
# Output: subtitle file(s) written to the current directory as <id>.<lang>.<ext> (json3/srt).
# Deps: yt-dlp. (Alternative SESSDATA-based API path documented in references/bilibili_api.md.)

ERROR: subtitle download failed. Inspect the failed interface and verify separately:
  - Not logged into bilibili.com in the chosen browser (subtitles are login-gated).
  - Browser cookie DB locked — close the browser and retry, or pass a different browser.
  - Target payment entitlement and the requested language/track response. Empty, missing and null subtitle fields are distinct; no file does not establish absence.
Alternative: export SESSDATA and use the player/wbi/v2 API path (see references/bilibili_api.md).
