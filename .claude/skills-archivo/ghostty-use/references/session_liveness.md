# Session liveness: storage layouts and classification rules

Verified against Claude Code (glm profile on 2026-10-04) and Codex CLI 0.16x
on macOS. All timestamps in this file are evidence anchors — re-verify after a
major app update rather than trusting the dates.

## Claude Code transcript layout

- Per-session file: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`
  (`/` → `-` encoding of the working directory at session start).
- JSON lines. Load-bearing fields:
  - `timestamp` — ISO-8601 with `Z` suffix; **UTC**.
  - `isApiErrorMessage: true` marks a real API-error event; when its text
    carries "Login expired" the channel is dead. Prose elsewhere in the
    transcript that merely mentions such strings is conversation, not an error
    event — a healthy session that discussed the phrase "Login expired" was
    misread as dead until classification keyed on the structured flag
    (2026-10-04).
  - First user message: `{"type":"user","message":{"content":[...]}}`.
- mtime lies: an idle TUI keeps touching its jsonl, so a same-day mtime
  coexisted with in-file events that stopped at 03:21 (measured 2026-10-04 on
  five sessions). Liveness must read content.
- Profile config dirs that symlink `projects/` into the shared pool make
  session files reachable from any profile: session storage is effectively one
  pool. Detect this at runtime (follow the symlink) instead of assuming either
  shape — a profile's own `projects` dir may be a symlink (`ls -la` shows
  `projects -> /Users/<user>/.claude/projects/`) while another profile's is a
  real directory.

## Codex rollout layout

- Per-session file:
  `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS>-<ulid>.jsonl`
  — **filename time is local; the embedded `timestamp` is UTC** (Z-suffix).
  This pairing cost one matching round-trip before it was pinned down
  (2026-10-04).
- Filename id is a hyphenated hex UUID (UUIDv7-shaped; synthetic example:
  `rollout-2026-01-01T00-00-00-00000000-0000-7000-8000-000000000001.jsonl`);
  its ordering prefix ≈ creation order. `codex resume <old-id>` may keep
  appending to the original file instead of forking a new one (both behaviors
  observed).
- Current Codex can name physical segments
  `rollout-...-<logical-thread>_<physical-rollout>.jsonl`. An underscore does not
  prove a subagent: the maintained history reader's metadata establishes identity
  and subagent status. The state database selects the current physical segment;
  verify `session_meta.id` through `read-codex-history` rather than taking the
  first filename match. Multiple segments without a valid indexed selection are
  ambiguous; report unknown. A missing selected segment or mismatched internal
  identity is unavailable evidence, not a license to use an older segment.
- Some sessions have **no rollout file at all** while the process lives —
  resume targets whose source rollout left the default tree, plus TUIs never
  used since start. A verified indexed identity with no usable file can classify
  `no-artifact`; missing index/reader or ambiguous identity classify `unknown`. Restoring replays
  `codex resume <id>` and stays best-effort. Absence is not data loss by
  itself.

## Classification

- `active` / `stale`: last in-file interaction within / beyond 48h (threshold
  is one constant in `scripts/ghostty_session.py`).
- `dead-channel`: structured `isApiErrorMessage` + "Login expired" text.
  Restore reopens history; the TUI stops at `/login`. The keychain may still
  hold a refreshToken with a future expiry while the account itself refuses
  auth — the token's own clock proves nothing about the account.
- `api-error` suffix: other structured API errors in the tail.
- `no-artifact`: no usable file for an otherwise verified indexed identity.
- `unknown`: Codex reader/index unavailable or rollout identity cannot be proved.
  Default active-only restoration skips it; explicit `--only` or `--all` preserves
  the user's option to resume the recorded ID. Report the boundary.

## Misclassification war stories (why each rule exists)

1. **mtime vs content timestamps** — five sessions read "active this
   afternoon" while in-file events had stopped at 03:21; idle TUI file-touching
   caused it. Rule: liveness reads content.
2. **Prose false positive** — a healthy session that discussed the phrase
   "Login expired" was graded dead-channel; classification now keys on the
   structured flag only.
3. **argv[0] instability** — matching processes by name missed every bare-name
   process and produced two false "all sessions gone" reports in one session.
   Rule: anchor on the command-line UUID at argv-token boundaries, skipping
   companion/snapshot/daemon processes. (For argv that carries no UUID — fresh
   TUIs — this rule is extended by item 4.)
4. **Fresh-TUI invisibility** — only resume/fork writes the session UUID into
   argv; a brand-new TUI has none. On 2026-10-07, 11 of 25 live Ghostty
   sessions were fresh TUIs, and argv-only anchoring silently dropped them
   from the snapshot, from `check` presence (false "gone"), and from
   `restore`'s already-live filter (which would have reopened duplicate tabs).
   Rule: UUID-less live TUIs are anchored from transcript storage — the
   session file must be born at or after the process start (`ps lstart`,
   second-truncated, vs float birthtime; a ½s clock tolerance is the whole
   leeway — anything more only admits fresh corpse files, and one born 3s
   before start is already a corpse). lstart field order varies by platform
   locale ("Tue Oct  6 …" vs "Tue  6 Oct …", parse both). The bucket name
   keeps the capitalization seen at creation (match case-insensitively) and
   encodes every non-[A-Za-z0-9-] character as `-` (pinned on 347 real buckets
   plus a live `foo_bar` probe: `/`, `.`, space, CJK and `_` all fold). The
   file must pass internal identity verification (Claude head `cwd` within 40
   lines — the worst real file first records it at line 9; Codex
   `session_meta` id+cwd); a file with no verifiable cwd fails closed rather
   than passing on the bucket alone. A node wrapper and its vendor child on
   one pty count as one TUI — as competitors they once tied every offer and
   excluded all three live codex sessions (2026-10-07 live regression caught
   by re-running the snapshot after the assignment rewrite). When several
   fresh TUIs share one bucket, candidates bind disjointly (one file per TUI,
   closest verified claim first, fallback to the TUI's next candidate);
   equidistant claims refuse to the unresolved section, and whatever still
   matches nothing is reported as an unresolved row, never dropped silently.
   Corpse files from dead earlier TUIs are the standing theft hazard: the
   2026-10-07 pkm bucket held one born 10s before a live TUI's start, and the
   disjoint-assignment rule plus the ½s leeway are what keep it from winning.
