    ``line_keywords`` is an optional cheap pre-check: when given, a line is
    only handed to ``json.loads`` if it contains at least one of these
    strings as a raw substring (case-insensitive — callers pass already
    case-folded keywords and this function case-folds the line to match).
    This exists because ``json.loads`` plus walking the resulting structure
    is the expensive part of a keyword search, and file-level filtering
    (skip whole files with no occurrence anywhere) turned out not to be
    enough on its own: a keyword common across a user's session history
    (e.g. "embedding") can appear in most FILES while still appearing in
    only a small fraction of the LINES within each one, so ruling out
    individual non-matching lines before parsing them is where the real
    remaining cost lives.

    Like the file-level pre-filter in ``files_possibly_matching``, this is
    an over-approximation: a line can pass this check and still turn out to
    have no *matchable* record once parsed (the keyword landed in a raw
    JSON key/structural byte rather than an actual field value, or in a
    field the structured extractor deliberately excludes). It must never be
    an under-approximation — never skip a line that a full parse would have
    matched — which is what makes it safe to use as a pure speedup.

    ``strict=True`` converts malformed JSON, decoding failures, and I/O errors
    into exceptions. Completeness-sensitive callers use it so a partially read
    file can never be rendered as an authoritative zero-match result. The
    default stays tolerant for title/preview inventory paths where one damaged
    record should not erase the rest of a session listing.

    Only pass ``line_keywords`` from a call site that has independently confirmed
    skipping unselected lines cannot corrupt some other accounting the

    against the parsed strings?

    Pass the **original** keywords, never case-folded ones. ``"ß".casefold()``
    is ``"ss"`` — pure ASCII — so folding first makes this function answer
    "safe" for exactly the input that motivated rule 2 below, silently
    re-opening the hole it exists to close.

    Only when every keyword's bytes are *guaranteed* to appear verbatim in the
    file, and a byte scanner's notion of "equal" matches Python's. Three shapes
    break that guarantee, and each one silently loses matches rather than
    reporting an error — so all three fall back to full parsing:

    1. **Characters JSON is required to escape**: control characters, ``"``,
       and ``\\``. An embedded newline is stored as the two bytes ``\\n``, a
       quote as ``\\"``, a backslash as ``\\\\`` — so a literal search for the
       raw character cannot find the escaped form actually sitting in the
       file. This is not a quirk of some serializers; every conforming JSON
       writer does it, including the one that produced these transcripts.
       Quoted error fragments (``Error: "ENOENT"``), config snippets
       (``"model": "opus"``), and Windows paths are exactly the sort of thing
       people search history for.

    2. **Non-ASCII.** Two independent failures. (a) ``json.dumps`` defaults to
       ``ensure_ascii=True``, which stores ``café`` as ``caf\\u00e9`` — the
       UTF-8 bytes are simply not in the file. Claude Code's own writer does
       not do this, but archives rewritten by other tooling do. (b) Even in
       raw UTF-8, case-insensitive folding disagrees across implementations:
       measured on this corpus's tooling, Python ``casefold()`` does *full*
       folding (``straße`` == ``STRASSE``), ``rg -i`` does only *simple*
       folding (matches ``STRAẞE`` but not ``STRASSE``), and ``/usr/bin/grep
       -i`` matches neither. A pre-filter that disagrees with the real matcher
       drops sessions, and it would drop *different* ones depending on whether
       ``rg`` happens to be installed.

    3. **A literal ``/``.** Optional in JSON — Python does not escape it — but
       some writers emit ``\\/``, so it is excluded for the same reason.

    Falling back is always the safe direction: it costs speed, never a missed
    match. This function therefore keeps non-ASCII out of the *line-level*
    literal filter. Callers may still use the separate file-level mixed-JSON
    regex below for uncased Unicode such as CJK. Correctness first: this tool's
    callers are told they may conclude a topic is absent from a no-match result.

    exact regex whose every code point accepts either raw UTF-8 or its JSON
    ``\\u`` representation; that covers fully escaped *and mixed* JSON strings
    without admitting every file that happens to contain some unrelated
    Unicode escape.

    File-level Unicode filtering is limited to uncased code points (CJK,
    emoji, symbols).  Cased non-ASCII text such as ``café`` falls back to full
    parsing: raw UTF-8 can be handled by ``rg -i``, but an archive may encode
    uppercase ``É`` as ``\\u00c9`` while the query's lowercase ``é`` is
    ``\\u00e9``.  Treating every file containing any ``\\u`` as a candidate
    preserved correctness but destroyed the speedup on real archives.

    session file, ``json.loads`` every line, extract the searchable text, and
    substring-match keywords against it — parses every byte of every file
    even when the overwhelming majority contain none of the keywords at all.
    On a single project of 294 files / 1.6GB that pure-Python loop measured
    3.5+ minutes of CPU time without completing; ``rg``/``grep`` scan the same
    bytes at native speed and can usually rule out most files in well under a
    second, letting the expensive path run only on the handful of files that
    are actually candidates.

    Deliberately an OVER-approximation, never an under-approximation: keys
    excluded from search on purpose (``id``, ``tool_use_id``, ``signature`` —
    see ``_flatten_search_strings``) can still contain a keyword's raw bytes,
