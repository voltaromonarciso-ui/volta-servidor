# Docker Deep Analysis

Detailed Docker analysis workflow referenced from `SKILL.md`. Use this when development-environment cleanup involves Docker images, containers, volumes, or build cache.

## Step 2A: Docker Deep Analysis

Phase 1 is metadata-only. `docker info`, `docker image ls`, `docker ps -a`, `docker volume ls`, `docker system df -v`, `docker image inspect`, and `docker builder du` query existing daemon state. Do not run `docker run`, pull an image, or mount a volume in this phase. If metadata cannot establish a volume's value, stop and use the separately authorized inspection gate in Step 2C.

Use agent team to analyze Docker resources in parallel for comprehensive coverage:

**Agent 1 — Images**:
```bash
# List all images
docker images --no-trunc --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}\t{{.CreatedSince}}"

# Identify dangling images (no tag)
docker images -f "dangling=true" --format "{{.ID}}\t{{.Size}}\t{{.CreatedSince}}"

# For each image, check if any container references it
docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=<IMAGE_ID>" --format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

**Agent 2 — Containers and Volumes**:
```bash
# All containers with status
docker ps -a --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Size}}"

# Full per-image, per-container, and per-volume allocation tables
docker system df -v

# Identify dangling volumes
docker volume ls -f dangling=true

# For each volume, check which container uses it
docker ps -a --filter "volume=<VOLUME_NAME>" --format "{{.Names}}"
```

**Agent 3 — System Level**:
```bash
# Docker disk usage summary
docker system df

# Build cache
docker builder du

# Container logs size
for c in $(docker ps -a --format "{{.Names}}"); do
  echo "$c: $(docker inspect --format='{{.LogPath}}' $c | xargs ls -lh 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $5}')"
done
```

**Version Management Awareness**: Identify version-managed images (e.g., Supabase managed by CLI). When newer versions are confirmed running, older versions are safe to remove. Pay attention to Docker Compose naming conventions (dash vs underscore).

### Physical-release reporting rules

Docker's numbers use different scopes. Do not copy an image's displayed `SIZE` into the plan as bytes guaranteed to return to the macOS Data volume.

- In the Images table from `docker system df -v`, `UNIQUE SIZE` is the best upper bound for deleting the final reference to one image. `SHARED SIZE` cannot be assigned to one deletion; it is released only when no remaining image references those layers. Multiple tags may point to the same image ID, so deleting one tag may release zero.
- Container `SIZE` is the writable layer estimate inside the Docker VM. Treat it as an upper bound until the exact container is removed.
- Local-volume `SIZE` is allocation inside the Docker VM. It is not proof that the host APFS volume will immediately gain the same amount.
- If shared-layer effects or runtime details prevent a defensible per-object number, write `unknown` or `upper bound: <value>` in the Phase-2 report. An honest unknown satisfies the contract; a false precise number does not.
- **A summed total needs a second method before it enters a plan.** Adding per-image `UNIQUE SIZE` values is an easy sum to make and an easy one to get wrong — layers can be shared across images the filter excluded, and container references can pin a layer that looks unreferenced in the images table alone. Recompute the total from a second direction (`docker system df -v` aggregate, or the shared-layer graph built from `docker image inspect` over every candidate) and treat any disagreement as a stop. On 2026-09-19 an independently reviewed sweep of a candidate set reported "6 dangling images, all deletable" came back as 6.38 GiB net reclaimable with 2 images still referenced by containers — the first sum was structurally incapable of seeing the second fact. A number that no second method has touched is a claim about your arithmetic, not about the disk.
- On OrbStack, object deletion can free space inside the VM while host `df` remains unchanged until sparse-image compaction. Report these as two separate postconditions.

## Step 2B: OrbStack-Specific Analysis

OrbStack users have additional considerations.

**data.img.raw is a Sparse File**:
```bash
# Logical size (can show 8TB+, meaningless)
ls -lh ~/Library/OrbStack/data/data.img.raw

# Actual disk usage (this is what matters)
du -h ~/Library/OrbStack/data/data.img.raw
```

The logical vs actual size difference is normal. Only actual usage counts.

**Post-Cleanup: Reclaim Disk Space**: After cleaning Docker objects inside OrbStack, `data.img.raw` does NOT shrink automatically. Treat **OrbStack Settings → Reclaim disk space** as a separate, explicitly approved manual plan item, not an automatic consequence of `docker rm/rmi/volume rm`. Record `du -k` on the sparse image and host `df -k /System/Volumes/Data` before and after the UI action.

**OrbStack Logs**: Typically 1-2 MB total (`~/Library/OrbStack/log/`). Not worth cleaning.

**Verifying which subdirectory drives real VM disk usage**: `du -h data.img.raw` on the macOS side gives an accurate top-level number. To see *which subdirectory inside the VM* is driving it (overlay2 vs volumes vs containers), a temporary container is required. That is not Phase-1 read-only: it creates and removes container state and could pull an image if written loosely. First list the exact command and obtain inspection-only approval. Resolve an already-present immutable full image ID, then use no network, no pull, a read-only root, and a read-only bind mount:

```bash
docker image ls --no-trunc
docker run --rm --name <INSPECTION_CONTAINER_NAME> \
  --pull=never --network=none --read-only --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --mount type=bind,src=/var/lib/docker,dst=/x,readonly \
  <LOCALLY_PRESENT_FULL_IMAGE_ID> sh -c "df -h /x; du -d 1 -h /x"
docker ps -a --filter "name=^/<INSPECTION_CONTAINER_NAME>$"
```

The final query must be empty. If no suitable image is already present, stop with analysis incomplete or submit a separate image-pull plan; never let this diagnostic command pull implicitly.

`/var/lib/docker` is inside the Docker Engine's own Linux VM (where `dockerd` runs on OrbStack), so this stays entirely within the VM — no macOS↔VM boundary to cross. It reports the real block device (typically `/dev/vdb1`) and real per-subdirectory sizes; verified to match a `--privileged --pid=host nsenter` approach byte-for-byte in testing, so prefer this unprivileged form. There's no verified reason to reach for `--privileged` for this check.

**BusyBox `du` uses `-d N`, not GNU's `--max-depth=N`** — the alpine image ships BusyBox coreutils, and the GNU-style flag errors with "unrecognized option: max-depth=1". `du -d 1`'s total will typically sum *higher* than `df`'s real "Used" figure (measured: `du` summed 170.6G against `df`'s 152.7G Used, same machine, same moment) because it double-counts `overlay2` layers shared across images. Trust `df`'s Used column for the true total; use `du -d 1` only for relative proportions between subdirectories, never as an absolute number.

## Step 2C: Double-Check Verification Protocol

Before deleting ANY Docker object, perform independent verification.

**On a machine with active development, the object list is live data.** `docker system df` and `docker images` can report different totals minutes apart if a build is running in the background (a CI job, another terminal's `docker compose build`, an IDE task). If time passed between the dry-run analysis and user confirmation, re-run the listing query fresh before executing — don't reuse the dry-run's cached list. A deletion plan built from a stale snapshot can delete an image that started being used since, or skip one that became eligible for a new user decision. Re-pulling costs one command.

**For Images**:
```bash
# Verify no container (running or stopped) references the image
docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=<IMAGE_ID>" --format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

# If empty → eligible for an explicit user decision; exact command: docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>
```

**For Volumes**:
```bash
# Verify no container mounts the volume
docker ps -a --filter "volume=<VOLUME_NAME>" --format "{{.Names}}"

# If empty → check if database volume (see below)
# If not database → still inspect ownership/value, then ask about: docker volume rm <VOLUME_NAME>
```

**Database Volume Red Flag Rule**: If volume name contains mysql, postgres, redis, mongo, or mariadb, content inspection is mandatory before any deletion proposal. This inspection creates a temporary container, so it happens only after the main skill's inspection-only authorization gate. Resolve an already-present full image ID and assign an exact temporary-container name:
```bash
docker run --rm --name <INSPECTION_CONTAINER_NAME> \
  --pull=never --network=none --read-only --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --mount type=volume,src=<VOLUME_NAME>,dst=/data,readonly \
  <LOCALLY_PRESENT_FULL_IMAGE_ID> sh -c "ls -la /data; du -d 1 -h /data"
docker ps -a --filter "name=^/<INSPECTION_CONTAINER_NAME>$"
```

The final query must be empty. Any command failure, missing local image, unexpected write requirement, or residual temporary container stops the investigation. Only after the user confirms the inspected data is not needed may the agent prepare a separate exact deletion plan.

**This rule also applies to anonymous volumes with no name to match against.** Heavy container churn (a service rerun often, an interactive dev loop) accumulates hundreds of anonymous volumes — 64-character hex names, no way to tell what's inside from the name alone. "Not referenced by any current container" is tempting to treat as sufficient evidence they're safe to remove. It isn't: a real inspection of 10 randomly sampled anonymous volumes found 5 of the 10 were live PostgreSQL data directories (`pg_wal`, `global/pg_control`, ~49MB each) — orphaned by containers whose lifecycle had ended, data still intact. "No container references it" and "the data is worthless" are unrelated facts; only content inspection tells you the second one.

Inspect every candidate rather than sampling and extrapolating, but keep the scope auditable: enumerate the exact approved volume names in the inspection plan and run one authorized read-only mount command per name. Do not discover a new population inside an execution loop.

```bash
docker run --rm --name <INSPECTION_CONTAINER_NAME> \
  --pull=never --network=none --read-only --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --mount type=volume,src=<EXACT_APPROVED_VOLUME_NAME>,dst=/data,readonly \
  <LOCALLY_PRESENT_FULL_IMAGE_ID> find /data -type f -print
```

Any volume reported non-empty goes through the full Database Volume Red Flag inspection above before deletion. Do not delete based on the sample-and-extrapolate shortcut this rule exists to warn against.

## Step 2D: Root-Cause Fix — Stop the Source, Not Just the Symptom

Everything above cleans up an existing backlog. When a Docker resource type keeps growing **across sessions** — not a one-time accumulation from unmanaged use, but the same category refilling every time you check — a cleanup pass alone is a symptom fix. It will be full again next week.

**The tell**: group images by repository (`docker images --format "{{.Repository}}" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn`). A single repository with hundreds of tags and only one or two active containers is not organic accumulation — it's a build pipeline tagging a new image every run and never cleaning up the old ones. Common in CI/CD scripts, `docker compose build` steps in a dev-loop Makefile target, or any workflow baking a commit SHA or timestamp into the image tag.

**Diagnose the source:**
1. Confirm the pattern: does the tag naming look programmatic (commit hash, build ID, timestamp)? That's the signature of an automated build, not manual `docker build` runs.
2. Find what produces it: grep the project for the tag-naming pattern to locate the script, Makefile target, or CI config that builds that repository.
3. Check whether cleanup logic already exists nearby but was never wired in — a `down`/`stop` command that deliberately preserves images (e.g. to keep the last-known-good build) is correct by design; it just means retention belongs at the *build* step instead.
4. **Confirm this repository is only consumed locally** before proposing an automated fix. The production-side analysis above tells you where images are *produced*, not where they're *consumed* — if the pipeline pushes to a registry that other machines or a CI/CD cluster pull from, a local `docker ps -a` check is blind to those remote consumers, and an image judged eligible locally may still be in active use elsewhere. This approach fits locally-built, locally-consumed repositories (a dev-loop `local-uat`-style target is the common case); a registry-backed multi-host pipeline needs registry-side retention, a different mechanism than what follows.

**Writing the fix needs separate user confirmation — the difference is *when* you ask.** One-time deletion is confirmed per exact object while the user is present; retention logic wired into a build script runs unattended every future time the build succeeds. Get the user's explicit sign-off on that recurring behavior before writing or committing it. This isn't satisfied by avoiding prune-family commands: unattended automation is a different scope from an approved in-session cleanup. Recommend a dry-run/log-only mode for a few runs before enabling real deletion.

**Once approved, this is still precision deletion — just automated and scoped to one repository:**
- Add retention logic that runs **after** the new build succeeds and any health check passes — never before. A failed new build shouldn't cost the last-known-good image.
- Keep the N most recent images by **verified creation time** (`docker image inspect --format '{{.Created}}'`), not the human-readable `CreatedSince` string (imprecise, not sortable) or raw `docker image ls` ordering (not guaranteed time-sorted). **Caveat**: reproducible-build tooling (Bazel, Nix, some BuildKit configs) can pin `.Created` to a fixed value like `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` instead of the real build time, so a fresh image can sort as "older" than genuinely older ones. If the project's tooling does this, cross-check against the next bullet before trusting the sort.
- Before removing each candidate, verify no container — including stopped ones — references it (`docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=<IMAGE_ID>"`), the same Step 2C protocol running inside the application's automation. This also covers the reproducible-build caveat: exclude whatever image the just-started container is using, independent of its timestamp.
- Never call this with a prune-family command. Still one `docker rmi <ID>` per verified-safe image, scoped to one repository — automation just means unattended instead of a human typing the ID.
- Wrap the retention step so its own failure doesn't fail the surrounding build/deploy. Verify the exact failure signal your subprocess-execution mechanism actually returns rather than assuming a field name — a wrong assumption there silently turns the failure branch into a no-op.

**Then clean the existing backlog** using the Step 2C workflow — the backlog is one-time debt, the source fix stops new debt from accumulating. Fix the source first if practical, then clear the backlog.

## Bonus: Dockerfile Optimization Discoveries

During image analysis, if you discover oversized images, suggest multi-stage build optimization:

```dockerfile
# Before: 884 MB (full build environment in final image)
FROM node:20
COPY . .
RUN npm ci && npm run build
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

# After: ~150 MB (only runtime in final image)
FROM node:20 AS builder
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

Key techniques: multi-stage builds, slim/alpine base images, `.dockerignore`, layer ordering.
