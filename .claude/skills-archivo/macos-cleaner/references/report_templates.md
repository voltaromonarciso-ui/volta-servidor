# Report templates

Use these templates after the read-only evidence phase. Apply the main skill's [safety and authorization contract](../SKILL.md#safety-and-authorization-contract): a report does not create cleanup authorization. Record the existing authorization covering the verified targets and consequences, or the exact confirmation still missing. Stop when authorization is missing or the user requested a plan-only phase.

## General phase-2 cleanup plan

```markdown
# macOS disk-space diagnosis and proposed repair

## Current state

- Timestamp: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ZONE OFFSET>
- Target identity: <ComputerName / LocalHostName / hostname>
- Volume: <exact mount>
- Disk: <total> total, <used> used, <available> available, <capacity>%
- Scope exclusions honored: <directories/services not inspected>

## Evidence

| Suspect | Observed value | Logical or physical? | Authority | Confidence |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| <subsystem/path> | <value + unit> | <logical/physical> | `<command>` | <complete/partial> |

## Ranked candidates

Keep nominal/path-accounted size separate from expected physical release so a
large APFS clone or shared-layer hotspot remains visible without becoming a
false savings promise.

| Rank | Exact candidate | Nominal/path-accounted size | Expected physical release | Confidence | Why this rank |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 1 | <exact target> | <observed or n/a> | <estimate or unknown> | <high/medium/low> | <safety + evidence + effort> |

State permission errors and incomplete scans. Never present a partial `du` total as the complete category size.

## Protected-service baseline

| Service | Process/parent | Listener | Launch mechanism | Health probe | Log-growth window |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <service> | <live values> | <live values> | <live value> | <result> | <timestamps + byte delta> |

## Proposed commands — not yet executed

| # | Exact command | Exact target | What changes | Recoverability | Expected physical release | User/service impact | Required postcondition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | `<command>` | <object/path/service> | <effect> | <reversible / Trash / backup / redownload-only> | <estimate + unit> | <impact> | <observable value> |

## Recommendation

Recommend <option> because <evidence-based reason>. Alternatives:

- <alternative>: <trade-off>
- <alternative>: <trade-off>

Expected result: <projected free space and capacity, with assumptions>.

## Authorization status

No state-changing command has run.

- Covering authorization: <original instruction and the verified targets/conditions it covers, or none>
- Missing confirmation: <exact target, consequence or user-supplied confirmation phrase still required, or none>
- Next action: <execute within covering authorization, stop for the missing confirmation, or hand off a plan-only result>
```

## Apple Content Caching variant

Use this compact variant with `references/apple_content_caching.md`:

```markdown
## Content Caching evidence

| Field | Current value | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| Activated / Active | <values> | <currently serving or not> |
| CacheLimit | <bytes/display> | <finite or unlimited> |
| CacheUsed | <bytes + GB> | Logical cached-content size; not release estimate |
| ActualCacheUsed | <bytes + GB/GiB> | Physical release basis |
| PersonalCacheUsed / iCloud | <bytes + GB> | Logical subset; do not add to ActualCacheUsed |
| DataPath allocated `du` | <KiB + GiB> | Independent physical cross-check |
| Peers | <address + current healthy/friendly/capabilities> | Read from target status; peer not modified |

## Preferred repair

<Deactivate target and flush / retain service with finite limit>.

Why: <peer health, target pressure, service requirement, target free-space math>.

## Exact command plan

| # | Command | Change | Recoverability | Postcondition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `<approved finite-limit command, if applicable>` | Replace unlimited with approved finite bytes | Set another approved finite value | `settings` shows finite limit |
| 2 | `sudo AssetCacheManagerUtil deactivate` | Stop target cache node | Separately authorized `activate` | `isActivated` says deactivated |
| 3 | `sudo AssetCacheManagerUtil flushCache` | Remove local Apple/iCloud cache copies | Redownload/peer transfer only | `ActualCacheUsed` reaches approved residual |

Expected physical release: <ActualCacheUsed-based estimate>.
Projected volume: <available GiB>, <capacity>%.

Impact:
- Apple/iCloud originals remain intact.
- Clients may rediscover another healthy cache over time.
- <protected service> must retain its process, listeners, launch mechanism, and healthy probe.
- No peer configuration changes.

Failure exits:
- Limit mismatch → stop before deactivation.
- Deactivation mismatch → report partial state; do not flush.
- Flush failure → report “deactivated but not purged.”
- Target still missed → second read-only analysis only.
```

## Docker object-level detail

List every object rather than reporting category totals:

```markdown
### Images

| Image ID | Repository:tag | Engine size evidence | Host physical release estimate | Referenced by running containers | Referenced by stopped containers | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <id> | <repo:tag> | <SIZE / SHARED / UNIQUE from `docker system df -v`> | <unknown or defensible upper bound> | <names/none> | <names/none> | <preserve/confirm exact removal> |

### Containers

| Name | Image | Status | Engine writable-layer size | Host physical release estimate | Restartable state | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <name> | <image> | <status> | <size> | <unknown or upper bound> | <what would be lost> | <preserve/confirm> |

### Volumes

| Volume | Engine volume size | Host physical release estimate | Mounted by | Inspected contents | Database/user-data risk | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <name> | <size> | <unknown or upper bound> | <all running/stopped containers> | <bounded inspection or incomplete> | <risk> | <preserve/confirm exact ID> |

No prune-family command is part of the plan.
```

For OrbStack, add **OrbStack Settings → Reclaim disk space** as a separate, explicitly approved manual plan item when host APFS recovery is required. Engine-object deletion and sparse-image compaction have different effects and postconditions; never promise host `df` recovery from Docker's object-size tables alone.

## Phase-4 result

```markdown
# Cleanup result

## Before and after

| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Used | <value> | <value> | <value> |
| Available | <value> | <value> | <value> |
| Capacity | <value>% | <value>% | <value pp> |
| Cleaned subsystem physical usage | <value> | <value> | <value> |

## Postconditions

- [ ] Approved target and only that target changed
- [ ] Required activation/configuration state matches
- [ ] Free-space and capacity targets are met
- [ ] Protected service process/listeners/launch mechanism/health match the baseline
- [ ] Observation window shows no immediate abnormal refill
- [ ] No user data, credentials, databases, or unrelated caches changed

## Exceptions

<none, or exact failed/mismatched postcondition and the resulting partial state>

If the target was missed, state: “No second cleanup was performed; the next step is read-only analysis.”
```
