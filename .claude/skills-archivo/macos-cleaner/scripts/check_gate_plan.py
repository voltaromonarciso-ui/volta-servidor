"""
Phase 2 entry-gate checker for the macos-cleaner skill.

Reads the classification table and the plan the agent wrote, then mechanically
enforces the gate rules stated in SKILL.md. Exit 0 is required before a plan
may be sent.

Usage:
    uv run scripts/check_gate_plan.py --table <gate-table.md> --plan <plan.md> \
        [--reference <path>] [--copy-budget <manifest.json>] [--verbose]

Options:
    --reference   Reference corpus the governing-rule quotes are verified
                  against. Defaults to the bundle's references/cleanup_targets.md
                  (resolved relative to this script). When the default is used,
                  the sibling references/*.md files and SKILL.md are accepted as
                  provenance too, because the gate contract allows a quote from
                  "the route's dedicated reference" and real plans also quote the
                  skill body. An explicit --reference is authoritative on its own.
    --copy-budget JSON copy rationale/peak budget; run on the destination host.
    --verbose     Also print per-row parse details.

Exit codes:
    0  every rule passed
    1  at least one rule failed (each failure names the rule and the detail)
    2  usage or parse error (missing/unreadable file, no arguments)
