description: >-
  Entry point for local AI conversation history across Claude Code, Codex and Kimi CLI: routes each
  request to the reader or continuation skill that owns it and keeps the cross-provider inventory.
  Use when the platform is unknown or plural ("what was I working on", "we discussed this once") and
  for any Kimi CLI history. When platform and action are already clear, load that skill directly.

# Local Conversation History — router

This skill decides **which** skill runs. It does not parse history itself, does
not own commands for a single provider, and never re-implements what an executor
already does. If you find yourself explaining flags for one provider, you are in
the wrong skill — hand off and stop.

## Route by platform × action

Establish two things before routing: **which platform** the conversation lived
on, and whether the user wants **evidence** (what was said/done) or
**resumption** (take the work forward).

| Platform | Read evidence | Continue the work |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `daymade-claude-code:read-claude-code-history` | `daymade-claude-code:continue-claude-code-work` |
| OpenAI Codex | `daymade-claude-code:read-codex-history` | `daymade-claude-code:continue-codex-work` |
| Kimi CLI | `read-claude-code-history`, with the Kimi scope named — see **Provider scope** | no continuation skill exists |

Resumption always follows a read. The continuation skills require a verified
read receipt; routing straight to them without one is a defect, not a shortcut.

**When the platform is not stated**, separate an exact identity from a memory
of content. With a complete session ID, first use the Codex exact-ID locator,
then the Claude Code exact-session lookup if Codex does not verify it. The
verified original record decides the provider and continuation skill; an ID
prefix does not. With only a title, date, quote, or remembered topic, use the
inventory or content-search route below and verify the original messages before
assigning a provider.

## Provider scope — the job only this entry point routes

Name the requested providers before handing off. Inventory and content recall
use different executors; do not assume a provider-specific default covers a
cross-provider request.

| Cross-provider need | Route to | Name this scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** — "what have I been working on", "list my recent chats", session titles/dates/IDs | Indexed metadata where available, then exact-session readers | Do not use `list_local_history.py --source all`: its date and output limits are applied after Claude session bodies are read. Report a gap if no indexed inventory exists. |
| **Content search** — "did we ever discuss X", find a quote, file, or tool result | `read-claude-code-history`, its indexed recall, then exact-session reader | Select the relevant indexed providers; inspect index coverage and freshness. Open only candidate sessions. |
| **Ranked recall** — wording may have drifted | `read-claude-code-history`, its hybrid recall index | The index states which providers it holds; do not infer coverage for an unindexed provider. |

Indexed recall accepts explicit Claude, Codex, and Kimi provider filters.

**Use supplied clues before broad discovery.** For a pasted quote with a known
project, date, or title, use indexed metadata to narrow candidates, then
verify their original messages. For Codex, follow **Locate a quoted exchange** in
`read-codex-history`. Inventory alone never establishes a content match; if its
candidates miss or its scope is incomplete, report the gap and refine the indexed query.
Keep the current Session excluded. A request for only an ID stops at verified
message evidence; it does not require reconstructing every unrelated conversation.

**Search history through the index or an exact known session.** A raw sweep of
every conversation is prohibited, including when an output limit or scan timeout
is set. The current raw-search date flags filter after files are read, so they
do not make that command bounded. If the index is missing, stale, or lacks a
provider, report that coverage gap; do not fall back to a corpus scan. Ranked
top-K results cannot support an absence claim.

**Kimi CLI has no other entry anywhere** — no dedicated skill exists for either
axis, so both routes above land in `read-claude-code-history`, which documents
its own Kimi home resolution.

Let the executor own exact-session lookup, indexed provider filters, coverage,
and output format. This skill names which providers are in scope.

## Intent decides the route — the word "history" does not

| The user's requested result | Route |
|---|---|
| A list of conversations: titles, dates, session IDs | The indexed inventory row under **Provider scope**; if unavailable, state the gap |
| The conversation where a topic, quote, file, or tool result appeared — "find that old chat", "did we ever discuss X" | The **indexed content search** row under **Provider scope**; use supplied clues to narrow candidates first. Listing titles alone is not evidence the content exists |
| Their own raw inputs in chronological order, verbatim | The matching reader's verbatim-input path. Preserve duplicates and session boundaries; duplicates are part of the ledger, not noise |
| Recent requests that may have stalled — "anything we recently forgot to finish?" / "最近提过却没推进的事" | The indexed inventory/content-search routes under **Provider scope**, then the matching exact-session readers. Verify candidates against current project records; a project registry alone does not cover unregistered requests |
| Picking work back up from an identified session | The matching continuation skill, after a read |

The requested output wins over the background motivation. If someone explains a
problem and then asks for a window of their own raw inputs, return that window —
the explanation's topic clues do not convert the request into a content search.

For a recent-unfinished-work request, keep the retrieval read-only. Establish
the requested time window and relevant providers, inspect index freshness, and
open only selected sessions through their owning readers. Pair each candidate's
original user request with the latest relevant handoff or completion evidence;
check the project's current decision/status source before calling it unfinished.
Keep completed work, user-paused work, external blockers, and work awaiting
acceptance distinct. Treat reminders, assistant plans, and uncompleted reference
bookmarks as leads, not proof of an outstanding commitment. Report the candidate,
next action, evidence source/date, and any unresolved coverage gap. Stop after
the requested inventory; do not resume old work or migrate tasks without that
authorization. The calling agent performs this reconciliation; the readers own
retrieval, and no mechanical check establishes real-world completion for them.

## Invariants that survive routing

For remembered facts, identify the exact proposition before searching: account
count, account users, and an event's execution identity are different questions.
Check three evidence lanes in selected sessions: direct user words, assistant
retellings as locators, and original external records previously read by tools.
An assistant's quote locates the source; it does not replace that source. Use the
provider reader's complete tool-evidence route when the target is a prior read.

When the user says “search again”, change a concrete search dimension: source
lane, indexed provider/date/project scope, literal versus semantic matching, or
the selected session's original records. Do not end the retry with the same
ranked prose query and different synonyms alone. State which coverage changed.
Keep a found subclaim separate from an unfound remainder; current explicit user
facts remain authoritative even when their historical wording is not located.
Preserve original evidence values; do not silently redact, replace, or summarize
the stored text while exporting a record.

- **Coverage.** Read the index's provider and source scope plus its freshness
  frontier. An archive or provider outside that scope is unknown. A missing
  required source cannot support an absence claim.
- **Self-match.** The current session records the user's question and this
  agent's own commands, so it matches almost any query about itself. Exclude the
  current session ID before treating a hit as historical evidence.
- **Zero results are not absence.** Ranked recall can miss different wording
  and unindexed records. State coverage; do not convert an empty result into
  "it never happened".
- **Ask whether a word is the topic's name or the way you talk about it.** A
  search for `技术选型` over a corpus where the user actually said 用哪个 and
  不要闭门造车 returns almost nothing — measured: 10 hits against 163 real
  occurrences, because a Chinese phrase only matches on a token boundary. When
  searching one person's corpus, search the way they speak: imperatives,
  negations, and concrete scene sentences, not the label a design document would
  give the topic. A zero hit on a topic name cannot support an absence claim;
  widen to the phrasing that person would have used first, and say which forms
  you tried.
- **A zero has three causes and only one of them is "no history".** The other
  two are a home that was never found and a scope that excluded everything, and
  none of the three looks different in an empty table. This bites Kimi hardest:
  its documented default home is not where every install puts it — a desktop
  client can bundle the CLI inside its own runtime and keep sessions there — and
  its sessions belong to their own workspaces, so a default run inside some other
  repository returns nothing on a store full of conversations. Rule out both
  before reporting absence: name the home that was actually read, and say what
  project scope was in effect. The inventory prints a diagnostic line when a home
  is missing, so quote it when it appears — but a **located** home that yields
  zero prints no diagnostic at all, and the search path prints none in either
  case, so never treat a silent empty result as the reader confirming absence.
  `read-claude-code-history` owns how to locate a home and which scope flags the
  inventory needs.

## Do not

- Do not run provider-specific parsing, SQLite, `rg`, `jq`, or JSONL pipelines
  here. Every one of those belongs to an executor that already handles its
  store's schema, archives, and failure modes.
- Do not copy an executor's flags into this file beyond the three that name
  provider scope (`--source`, `--codex`, `--kimi`) — those are this skill's own
  subject. Every other flag changes on the executor's schedule; copying one here
  makes this file drift silently and then teach the wrong command.
- Do not route to a continuation skill to answer a question about the past.
  Reading is evidence; continuing changes the world.
