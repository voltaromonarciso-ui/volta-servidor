# Common Issues and Fixes

## Profile fails to launch

Check that `~/.claude/settings/<profile>.json` exists and is valid JSON:

```bash
python3 -m json.tool ~/.claude/settings/kimi.json
```

Also check that the profile directory has `.claude.json`:

```bash
test -f ~/.claude-profiles/kimi/.claude.json
```

`claude.json` is a legacy filename and is not enough for modern Claude Code when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points at the profile directory. Re-run `claude-profiles-init` to create missing `.claude.json` files.

## Doctor reports a broken symlink such as `image-cache`

Run:

```bash
claude-profiles-init
```

Profile symlinks intentionally point back into `~/.claude`. Claude Code may create optional runtime directories such as `image-cache/` and later remove them. Current `claude-profiles-init` prunes stale symlinks whose target was under `~/.claude`, then rebuilds the links that still have a real base directory.

## `claude-profile` command not found

The shell function is loaded by sourcing `claude-profiles.sh`. Either:
- Run `source ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/claude-profiles.sh`, or
- Open a new terminal so the rc-file source takes effect.

## Plugin installed from a profile does not appear in `claude plugin list`

In this multi-profile setup, each profile's `installed_plugins.json` is a symlink into the shared base store. The CLI (observed on 2.1.273) silently skips writing that file when the path is a symlink: install prints "Successfully installed", the cache and `enabledPlugins` update, but the plugin never registers, so `claude plugin list` and the session's skill list never see it.

After any `claude plugin install`, verify against the file, not the CLI receipt:

```bash
grep -c plugin-name ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
```

Count 0 → reinstall from the config dir that owns the real file (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude claude plugin install name@marketplace`), or add the entry manually. Full failure signature, three-way reproduction, and ghost-enable cleanup: [`claude-skills-troubleshooting/references/known_issues.md`](../claude-skills-troubleshooting/references/known_issues.md) → "Symlinked installed_plugins.json Silently Skipped on Install".

## Third-party model gets Anthropic errors

Make sure the profile's `env` block includes:
```json
{
  "ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH": "false",
  "DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK": "1",
  "DISABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
  "DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER": "1"
}
```

These flags prevent Claude Code from trying Anthropic-only features when talking to a third-party endpoint.

Related boundary: `advisorModel` (a top-level settings.json key holding an
Anthropic model name like `"fable"`) is in the converger's DENYLIST alongside
`model` — third-party endpoints cannot serve that literal, so it is treated
as provider identity and never synced. If a profile's settings.json still
carries `advisorModel` from before 2026-08-18 (when it was synced by
mistake), delete the key from that profile's settings.json.

## Subagents use the wrong model

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` to the same value as `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` in the profile settings. Otherwise subagents may fall back to the default Anthropic model.

## Statusline ctx jumps or reads far above the real context

Symptom: the statusline's `ctx` figure leaps by hundreds of thousands of
tokens in one turn with no large content entering (observed 2026-09-15:
94,087 → 719,177 across a turn whose only new input was a ~2 KB hook
message), or climbs well above what the transcript actually contains.

Cause: the numerator is the endpoint's own usage report, not a measurement of
the conversation. Statusline scripts sum the provider-reported
`input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` of
the last response, and some Anthropic-compatible relays and shims inflate or
double-count those fields on long sessions (observed the same day: one turn
reported `input_tokens=359,753` plus `cache_read_input_tokens=359,424` for a
real prompt of roughly 96K, and a long session's `cache_read` drifted to
~2.4x its actual content). The denominator — the configured or assumed
window — is a separate number and is fine. Fresh single-shot requests are
unaffected: with no cache history, reported usage matched the sent prompt
within tens of tokens.

Fix: treat the `ctx` figure on third-party endpoints as a magnitude hint, not
a measurement. To learn a provider's real context size, send known-size
inputs and compare reported vs. sent — a ladder (e.g. 150K / 300K / 700K /
1M tokens, with a needle early in the filler and a question about it at the
end) also verifies the model actually reads that deep. Claude Code's own
compaction does not appear to consume these inflated reports — it fired far
later than the inflated figure implied — but the mechanism is unverified
here. Anchor the window explicitly (`[1m]` marker or
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` / `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`) instead
of trusting the displayed number.

## The advisor answers on the same model as the session

Symptom: the session runs on the flagship tier and every advisor call comes
back from that same model — each advisor record in the session JSONL carries
an `advisorModel` equal to the session's `model` string (observed 2026-09-05
on a `claude-fable-5-1` session) — and it looks as if the pairing is
misconfigured.

Cause: an equal pair is allowed and nothing announces it. `advisorModel` is
its own setting; `/model` rewrites `model` and leaves it alone (observed
2026-09-05). The pairing check rejects an advisor that is *less* capable than
the main model or one the main model does not support — those are the only
two `/advisor` warnings in the 2.1.260 binary — so raising the main model to
the advisor's tier silently turns the advisor into a same-model second read.
It still gets the whole transcript as a separate call; it just brings no
stronger reasoning.

Fix — pick one:

- Pin a different advisor: `/advisor <model>`. **It writes the top-level
  `advisorModel` key into the global `~/.claude/settings.json`**, not the
  project's `.claude/settings.json` (observed 2026-08-13: run inside one
  project checkout, the key appeared in the global file), so the choice
  follows every project — and, as a DENYLIST key, reaches no third-party
  profile.
- Turn it off: `/advisor off` removes that key from the same global file
  (observed 2026-09-05: run inside another project, the global file's mtime
  matched the command to the second and the key was gone). It takes effect
  in the session that ran it and in every session started afterwards — that
  session made no further advisor calls, and later sessions on the same
  model carry no `advisorModel` on any record — but a *different* session
  that was already running kept calling the advisor (all observed
  2026-09-05). Restart those windows if the `off` must reach them.
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADVISOR_TOOL` also exists in the 2.1.260 binary; it
  has not been exercised here.

Which model answered a given call is on the assistant record itself
(`advisorModel`, next to `effort`) — see
`read-claude-code-history/references/session_file_format.md`.

## Marketplace says "corrupted installLocation"

Each profile needs its OWN `known_marketplaces.json` — its `installLocation` is
config-dir-specific (Claude validates with `path.resolve`, which does NOT resolve
symlinks), so it cannot be shared across profiles. `claude-plugins-sync.py` rebuilds them.
It runs automatically every time `claude-profile` init/launches; to run manually:

```bash
python3 ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/claude-plugins-sync.py
```

## Skill is installed in default Claude but missing in a third-party profile

Claude Code stores the enabled plugin map in each config directory's `settings.json`.
Run the profile syncer so every profile mirrors the default profile's `enabledPlugins`:

```bash
python3 ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/claude-plugins-sync.py
```

This file-level fix also happens automatically, usually within seconds, when
the `ai.daymade.claude-skill-source-sync` LaunchAgent is installed (see "Local
skill source changes do not appear in Claude Code or Codex" below) — `claude
plugin enable/disable --scope user` writes to `~/.claude/settings.json`, which
is itself a watched path, and the watcher's sync pass calls this same script.
Run the command above manually when the watcher is not installed, or to force
convergence without waiting (verified 2026-08-22: `launchctl`'s per-agent run
counter incremented within 5s of a bare `touch` on the watched file).

Restart the affected Claude Code window after syncing — a running session
does not re-read `enabledPlugins` mid-session, whether the file was synced by
hand or by the watcher.

## Default-profile behavior settings don't reach third-party profiles

Symptom: a behavior preference set on the default profile has no effect in
third-party profiles — e.g. a workflow launched in a Kimi window fans out far
beyond the size guideline you configured on the default profile.

Cause: those settings do not live in `settings.json`. Claude Code keeps a
second per-profile file, and its path is **asymmetric** (verified on disk
2026-08-17): the main profile's is `~/.claude.json` (a sibling of the config
dir), while each third-party profile's is `~/.claude-profiles/<name>/.claude.json`
(inside the config dir). A stale pre-migration copy at `~/.claude/.claude.json`
is not the live file. Nothing in the symlink layout or the settings.json sync
covers this layer, so a key like `workflowSizeGuideline` set on main silently
exists on zero third-party profiles.

Incident that established this (2026-08-17): `workflowSizeGuideline: small`
was set on the default profile; 10/11 third-party profiles had no copy of the
key at all. A Kimi session launched a Dynamic Workflow whose system prompt
therefore contained no size guidance, and fanned out to 30+ agents. Hooks and
every other `settings.json` key were fully converged at the time — the drift
was exclusively in this second layer, invisible to the old sync.

Fix: `sync-profile-settings.py` (2026-08-17 onward) converges an allowlist of
confirmed behavior keys (`BEHAVIOR_KEYS` in the script) into each profile's
`.claude.json` at session start. Manual re-convergence:

```bash
python3 ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/sync-profile-settings.py --all
```

Restart the affected window — the harness reads `.claude.json` at startup, so
a sync never changes the running session.

**Scope — every run covers every profile.** The argument-free SessionStart call
converges all of `~/.claude-profiles/*` plus `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so the next
profile to start a session carries the backlog for every profile that has not.
No flag changes that scope; `--check` and `--all` only choose audit-vs-write.
`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is skipped when it is unset, empty, or holds no
`settings.json` / `.claude.json` — an unset value otherwise resolves to the
cwd and gets a `settings.json` fabricated into it. A run prints one line per
profile it actually changed and nothing when there is no drift — **a silent
session start means converged**. When adding a hook to the default profile,
confirm it appears in a profile you have not opened since; the converged line
naming it is the evidence.

Corrupt files on either layer: a corrupt profile `settings.json` or
`.claude.json` is rebuilt from main with a WARNING line (the original bytes
are retained in `<file>.sync-backup`); a corrupt MAIN file aborts the run and
converges nothing — a corrupt main reads as empty, so proceeding would strip
keys from every profile. Exit code is 2 for `--check`/`--all`, and 0 for the
argument-free SessionStart call, which warns and lets the session start. A
profile the run could not process — the wrong-shape case in the next paragraph —
splits the same way, so an audit that skipped a profile says so instead of
reporting a clean run.

A profile whose **whole file** is valid JSON but the wrong shape (a list, string or
number instead of an object) is reported as `[name] ERROR: ...` and skipped;
convergence continues with the remaining profiles, because under "converge
everything" one malformed profile would otherwise cancel the run for all of them.
A single **field** of the wrong shape is handled differently: a non-object `env`
(e.g. `"env": "oops"`) is treated as empty and rebuilt from main — the same
semantic as a corrupt file — with the original bytes retained in
`<file>.sync-backup`.

**Classifying a NEW key (the tripwire):** when a future Claude Code release
adds a key that differs between main and a profile, the sync prints one line
per profile:

```
[kimi] .claude.json UNCLASSIFIED drift: 'someNewKey' — classify in sync-profile-settings.py: ...
```

(One line per drifted key per run, until classified — a key nobody
classifies keeps reporting at every session start. That persistence is
deliberate: a report that fires once and silences itself is a report that
trains people to wait it out.)

That report is the mechanism working as designed — do not silence it by
ignoring it. Open the script and classify the key:

- It changes behavior and users set it once for all profiles → add to
  `BEHAVIOR_KEYS` (it will sync from now on).
- It is runtime state / a cache / a counter / a migration flag / identity or
  credentials → teach `is_state_key()` a pattern or exact name (never sync;
  syncing `projects`, `oauthAccount`, or migration flags across profiles
  corrupts state or account identity).
- It is known but deliberately per-profile → `GRAY_ACKNOWLEDGED` with the
  reason, so it stays silent.

The classifier was calibrated against the live key census on 2026-08-17:
main's file held 102 top-level keys, classified 7 behavior / 91 state /
4 acknowledged-gray / 0 unclassified (reproduce: classify every top-level
key of `~/.claude.json` with `BEHAVIOR_KEYS` + `is_state_key()` +
`GRAY_ACKNOWLEDGED`). One accepted blind spot, in the fail-safe direction:
a FUTURE behavior key whose name happens to contain a state substring
(`last`/`tip`/`count`/`seen`/`usage`/`token`/...) is classified as state —
silently never synced, and NOT covered by the tripwire report. The backstop
is an occasional manual census (same one-liner as above): eyeball the state
bucket for preference-looking names. Sync writes are backup + atomic
replace (backup chmod 600 regardless of source permissions), and were
verified to survive a live harness session rewriting the file (a marker key
written into an active profile persisted 30+ minutes of harness writes) —
but re-verification is cheap if a future Claude Code release changes write
semantics: write a marker into an active profile's `.claude.json`, keep
using the session, check the marker an hour later.

## A real profile's guard hooks vanished and its `env` has unfamiliar keys

Symptom: a profile stops firing its PreToolUse guards, and its `settings.json`
has `env` keys that belong to no provider. The file often shrank sharply.

Cause: the converger ran with a synthetic `CLAUDE_MAIN_CONFIG_DIR` while
`CLAUDE_PROFILES_ROOT` or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` still reached the real profile.
Scope is the union of those two, so the real profile converged toward the fake
main — `hooks` replaced wholesale by the fake main's object, `env` merged
per-key so the fake main's keys were added. Since v3.60.1 the env damage is
two-sided: the fake main's keys are still added, and every non-identity env
key the real profile had that the fake main lacks is now DELETED — including
credential keys a skill relies on. Identity keys (`ANTHROPIC_*`,
`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH`, `DISABLE_*`) survive. The run does name `hooks` among the
keys it synced and reports the removed env keys per profile, but nothing in it
says guards stopped firing — it reads as the converger doing its job.

Fix: restore from that profile's own backup, then verify byte-for-byte.

```bash
cp -p <profile>/settings.json.sync-backup <profile>/settings.json
```

Check size, JSON validity, top-level key count, `hooks` length, unexpected `env`
keys, and sandbox signatures such as `/bin/true`. Do not judge by the backup's
mtime: it is written with `shutil.copy2`, which preserves the source mtime, so
an old timestamp does not prove nothing was written.

Then scan the remaining profiles — scope is all of them, so one run can hit
several — and correct the invocation before running the script again (see "Never
run the converger against a synthetic main" in `SKILL.md`).

## Installation audit reports missing or unselected Skills

Run the inventory from the marketplace checkout root:

```bash
python3 daymade-claude-code/claude-switch-models-setup/scripts/skill-install-audit.py --json
```

Use the result definitions and environment overrides in
[`skill-install-audit.py`](../scripts/skill-install-audit.py) as the contract.
Read the reported items rather than treating exit 0 as a delivery verdict.
Inspect `SOURCE_CHECKOUT_BEHIND` and `DAEMON_RUNTIME_LAG` before deciding that
an empty finding is current; compare against fresh hosted state when that matters.
The checkout comparison alone uses cached remote-tracking refs.

The `CODEX_*` sections inspect Codex's expanded selection and source links.
This audit does not inspect `claude_active_marketplaces` or Claude personal Skill
links. For that route, use the source syncer's dry-run and registered source
inventory, then the requested Claude target's fresh-host gate. Plugin inventory
alone cannot determine whether a personal Skill is available.

For `CODEX_SELECTED_MISSING`, resolve the selected name against the source
inventory and inspect its actual link. Check the expanded activation policy,
including marketplace selections, before editing a name. Repair the source or
link when the selection is intentional; remove a selection only when it is no
longer wanted. For `CODEX_UNLISTED_ENABLED` or `MANUAL_LINK_RISK`, decide whether
that Skill should be active before changing policy. Do not add every reported
name or remove links merely to make the report empty.

Follow the local-source workflow in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) and the
[source topology](local-source-sync-architecture.md). Preview synchronization
without `--apply`, inspect the exact affected paths, then apply an authorized
repair through the installed sync entry. Do not hand-create Skill links or replace
a pinned runtime with the checkout. For `NAME@marketplace` installation or
enablement findings, use that exact qualified identity with the official plugin CLI.

Re-run the inventory after repair. Then use the installed `skill-governance`
fresh-host acceptance workflow for the requested Claude Code or Codex target.
Existing sessions retain their startup catalog; a file/link check is not a fresh
host discovery check.

## Local skill source changes do not appear in Claude Code or Codex

Resolve the affected Skill's source and host policy using
[local-source-sync-architecture.md](local-source-sync-architecture.md). Use the
installation audit above for its plugin and Codex coverage; for Claude personal
links, inspect the source sync dry-run. `--print-watch-paths` lists inputs to the
watcher and does not verify links.

For structural changes, inspect registration, the generated plist, and the
[watcher logs](local-source-sync-architecture.md#macos-watcher). Require a successful
pass after the change; registration and exit status alone cannot prove it ran.
If no watcher is installed, run the installed daemon entry with `--install`.

### Advance the pin

Use this procedure only when the deployed helper links resolve into an installed
plugin cache. Checkout-linked deployments already read their source; do not switch
layouts as a version repair.

1. Read the deployed symlink targets, the corresponding installation record, and
   the source revision. Identify the daemon's separate configuration directory,
   qualified plugin identity, and the intended published revision before updating.
   Run the audit from the marketplace checkout root:

   ```bash
   python3 daymade-claude-code/claude-switch-models-setup/scripts/skill-install-audit.py --list DAEMON_RUNTIME_LAG SOURCE_CHECKOUT_BEHIND
   ```

   A non-empty `DAEMON_RUNTIME_LAG` proves the detected semantic version is older
   than the inspected source version. An empty section does not prove parity:
   an unrecognized/non-symlink entry, unavailable source, or unparseable version
   can also produce no lag finding. The checkout check uses cached remote refs;
   use a fresh hosted revision when verifying a published update.
2. Update the existing installation in that daemon configuration, not the normal
   Claude profile. Replace the placeholders with the identities read above:

   ```bash
   CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="<daemon-config-dir>" claude plugin marketplace update <marketplace>
   CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="<daemon-config-dir>" claude plugin update <plugin>@<marketplace>
   ```

3. Read back that profile's installed plugin record and its new cache directory.
   **Identify the helper links by listing the symlinks actually in the config
   directory, not by reading the deployment set in `scripts/setup.sh`.** That set
   is what the installer creates; a machine can carry links beyond it, and every
   link the list omits is one this step silently leaves on the old version.
   Measured 2026-09-16: the config dir held seven symlinks while the installer's
   set named five, and one of the two extras was `skill-install-audit.py` — the
   very tool that reports this lag, which would have gone on reporting from
   superseded code. Verify each candidate file against the intended source
   revision, retain the current link targets for rollback, then repoint those
   links to the new version. Use absolute targets and replace the link itself; do
   not run the checkout installer over a pinned layout or overwrite a real local
   file.
   Also inspect `sync-daemon-recorder.sh` and `sync-daemon-recorder.test.sh`:
   older installations may have ordinary copies, which symlink enumeration misses.
   Compare each with the installed version, preserve each copy at a unique backup
   path, then link to the corresponding file in the recorded plugin installation.
   Re-read both targets and compare their bytes with that installed version.
   Deploying these files does not require enabling or rerunning source sync.
4. Reinstall the LaunchAgent from the updated deployed entry:

   ```bash
   ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/sync-local-skill-sources-daemon.sh --install
   ```

   This provisions the installer-owned interpreter and runs a synchronization
   pass. Independently read back the helper targets, installation record, plist
   interpreter and scheduling fields, and a new success timestamp in the watcher
   log. Compare scheduling with the daemon implementation, not a copied interval
   in prose. Repeat the target-specific fresh-host gate from `skill-governance`.

For an authorized one-shot source-link repair, preview before applying:

```bash
python3 ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/sync-local-skill-sources.py
python3 ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/sync-local-skill-sources.py --apply
```

Inspect the dry-run between those commands. Follow the source architecture's
collision and recovery rules; legacy entries are not automatically retired.
Restart affected existing sessions after repairing metadata discovery.

## Claude-side skills never update while Codex-side sync looks perfectly healthy

`source-sync.out.log` keeps printing its success line, nothing warns, and
`launchctl` reports a zero last-exit status — yet `~/.claude/skills` gains nothing
and stale entries never get pruned.

Inspect `claude_active_marketplaces` in the actual activation manifest and check
whether the invocation uses `--skip-claude-skills`. The Claude root is managed only
when that list selects a discovered marketplace and the skip flag is absent.
Missing selected marketplaces fail validation. Missing `Claude skill ...` lines
do not establish that the root was skipped: already-correct direct entries can
be quiet, while plugin-provided or disabled entries emit decision lines.

Run against the actual root; the default is read-only:

```bash
sync-local-skill-sources.py --active-skills-manifest <manifest> \
  --claude-skills ~/.claude/skills
sync-local-skill-sources.py --active-skills-manifest <manifest> \
  --print-source-inventory
```

Use `marketplaces` to check registered membership and `selected_skills` to check
resolved identities. Inventory does not prove that a plugin is enabled or a
personal link exists; inspect those against the dry-run and current root.
If activation is missing, name only the intended owned marketplaces in the manifest.
The selection and plugin-state rules are defined in
[local-source-sync-architecture.md](local-source-sync-architecture.md#host-specific-user-skill-activation).

Do not blindly copy the root with `cp -a` for this check: relocating relative
symlinks changes what they resolve to. Prefer the actual-root dry-run; a mirror
must preserve each link's resolved target. Foreign links and real user-owned
bundles remain outside automatic retirement. Eligible stale managed links are
moved to `.source-sync-backups/` during an approved apply, not deleted.

## Source sync warns that an active skill name is registered by no checkout

`csk` prints this at launch, and the daemon writes it to `source-sync.err.log`:

```
WARN: <manifest>: 1 active skill name(s) registered by no discovered source checkout; skipped this pass: new-skill
WARN:   scanned <marketplace>: <checkout> (branch feat/other-work)
WARN:   scanned <other marketplace>: <checkout> (branch main)
WARN:   a checkout on a branch that predates the skill links it on the first pass after it catches up; a misspelled or retired name repeats this warning until the manifest is corrected
```

The name is usually right and a checkout is the problem. The manifest is written
against the marketplace as published on `main`; the syncer reads the working tree
of each local checkout, and a checkout parked on a feature branch registers only
what that branch had when it forked. The pass already converged for every other
name, so nothing else is waiting on this. Confirm where each checkout is:

```bash
python3 daymade-claude-code/claude-switch-models-setup/scripts/skill-install-audit.py --list SOURCE_CHECKOUT_BEHIND
git -C <checkout> status --short --branch
```

What to do depends on who owns that checkout. A clean checkout of your own goes
back with `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`; the next pass links the name
with no further step. A checkout another session is working on (uncommitted
changes, commits in the last hours) stays as it is: the name links on the first
pass after that work lands and the checkout returns to `main`. Switching,
stashing, or rebasing someone else's working tree to silence a warning destroys
their state.

If every checkout is on a current `main` and the warning persists, the name is
misspelled or the skill was renamed or retired. Correct the manifest.

Before daymade-claude-code v3.15.0 the same condition was a traceback,
`ValueError: unknown active skill name(s)`, that aborted the pass: the daemon
exited 1 on every trigger, and `~/.agents/skills` and the `enabledPlugins` mirror
stayed frozen for every skill (observed 2026-09-05, after a manifest edit made
against a checkout parked on another session's branch). A daemon still printing
that traceback runs a pinned copy older than the fix; advance the pin as the
previous section describes.

## Source sync aborts with `duplicate source skill name`

A pass that dies here never prints its "verified" line, so `source-sync.out.log`
reads as frozen rather than failed — the failure only ever lands in
`source-sync.err.log`:

```
ValueError: duplicate source skill name 'read-wechat-messages':
  .../claude-code-skills-pro/read-wechat-messages (read-wechat-messages@daymade-skills-pro)
  and .../cemakanshan-skills/read-wechat-messages (read-wechat-messages@cmks-skills)
```

Two marketplaces declare the same frontmatter name. First distinguish an
intentional pair of different bundles from an unfinished ownership transfer.
For intentional variants, retain both bundles and declare a host-specific
`source_preferences` rule under activation schema 3; see
[Explicit source preferences](local-source-sync-architecture.md#explicit-source-preferences).
A `candidate mismatch` means the declared identities and observed registrations
no longer match. Inspect both before changing policy; never choose by discovery
order or delete content to silence this error.

For an explicitly approved ownership transfer, adding to the target and removing
from the source are separate commits, so both registrations may coexist temporarily.
Two past transfers illustrate that window:

| skill | added to cmks main | removed from -pro main | window |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read-wechat-messages` | 09-16 20:21 (`7e424e8`) | 09-16 20:40 (`77542a72`) | 19 min |
| `llm-registry` | 09-21 14:09 (`2c8fe00`) | 09-21 15:00 (`06e543b4`) | 51 min |

The two measured incidents were main-to-main: all four commits above are ancestors
of `main`. Confirm your own pair the same way. A feature branch is not the cause of
*these two*, but it can still be the cause of yours: the syncer registers skills from
each checkout's **working tree**, so a checkout forked before the removal still exposes
the name — and a local branch that added the name does the same. The scanned-branch
WARN lines in this log are a different mode (previous section), not evidence either way:

```bash
git -C <checkout> merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> main && echo "on main"
```

For an approved transfer, follow its content-preservation and retirement plan;
this error alone does not authorize source removal. While the window is open
nothing is left half-synced — the guard
runs before the lock and before any write, so an aborted pass changes nothing at all.
What stops updating during the window: `~/.agents/skills` (Codex side),
`installed_plugins.json` and `known_marketplaces.json`. `~/.claude/skills` is
unaffected unless the manifest sets `claude_active_marketplaces`.

**To close an approved transfer window:** finish the authorized source retirement,
then update the affected clean checkout with `git -C <that checkout> pull --ff-only`. The syncer reads the **working tree** of each local checkout, so pushing
alone leaves the next pass still seeing the duplicate and the window never closes.
Confirm closure with a fresh `source-sync verified` line in `source-sync.out.log`.

## Several profiles launched at once fail with sync tracebacks

This should not happen on current scripts: `sync-local-skill-sources.py` and `claude-plugins-sync.py` share a cross-process lock before writing marketplace JSON, installed plugin metadata, or cache symlinks.

If you still see `FileExistsError` while creating a symlink or `FileNotFoundError` while replacing `known_marketplaces.json`, re-link the installed helper scripts and rerun. The install set and both link layouts (checkout-linked, or pinned plugin copy) are owned by step 2 of the setup workflow in SKILL.md: do not copy the files (a copy forks them and reintroduces the silent drift that step exists to prevent), and do not relink a pinned machine to the checkout.

Then verify with concurrent version probes:

```bash
# adjust the list to the profiles you actually configured
for profile in kimi glm deepseek stepfun anthropic; do
  tmux new-session -d -s "ccver-$profile" \
    "zsh -lc 'source ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/claude-profiles.sh; claude-profile $profile --version'"
done
```

## Profile loads skills but model request fails

Run with `--debug-file` and look for the order of events. If the log shows `Loaded ... installed plugins` and `Loaded ... unique skills` before an API error, the skill/profile sync layer is working and the failure is in the provider network/TLS path.

Example failure class: `UNKNOWN_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR` after all skill-loading lines. Diagnose the configured `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and the local proxy/TLS chain; do not treat that as a missing-skill problem.

## I want to add another provider

1. Copy a template to `~/.claude/settings/<new-provider>.json`.
2. Fill in the API key and base URL.
3. Update the model names to match that provider's Anthropic-compatible model IDs.
4. Run `claude-profiles-init`.
5. Add an alias to your shell rc file if desired.

## I want to remove a provider

Run:

```bash
claude-profile-rm <provider>
```

This deletes only the isolation directory (`~/.claude-profiles/<provider>/`). It does **not** delete `~/.claude/settings/<provider>.json`; remove that manually if you want it gone.
