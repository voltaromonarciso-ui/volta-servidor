# Context Window Configuration

Deep technical detail for the `[1m]` context-window marker and the reusable
"did this env var actually change the outgoing request" recipe. The SKILL.md
keeps only the decision rule (what to set per provider) and points here for the
mechanism — because the rule is needed at template-writing time, while the
mechanism is reference knowledge you reach for when something looks wrong.

## The `[1m]` marker — full mechanism

When `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (or `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`) ends in the literal four characters `[1m]`, Claude Code's own CLI — not the upstream provider — parses that suffix before sending a request:

1. Strips `[1m]` off the `model` field, so the upstream provider receives the clean ID (e.g. `moonshotai/kimi-k3`, never `moonshotai/kimi-k3[1m]`).
2. Adds `context-1m-2025-08-07` to the outgoing `anthropic-beta` header.

In a 2026-07-21 local-server capture, the compared requests using `moonshotai/kimi-k3[1m]` and `moonshotai/kimi-k3` matched in the other inspected fields (`context_management`, `output_config`, `metadata`, and the remaining beta headers). Treat that as one measurement, not a guarantee that every request field stays fixed. Check the model field, context beta and reported client window directly; repeat the same condition before attributing other header differences to the suffix. Independently launched clients can carry different dynamic beta headers. Use the capture recipe below rather than internal debug logs to inspect the transmitted request.

Distinguish the client budget from provider capacity:

- **It's entirely client-side.** The upstream provider never sees `[1m]`. Whatever the provider's real context ceiling is, it's set by their own backend, independent of this flag — a third-party model can genuinely accept 500K+ tokens with `[1m]` absent from the request the whole time (separately confirmed: a bare ~506K-token request to `moonshotai/kimi-k3`, no `[1m]` anywhere, HTTP 200'd and correctly recalled a marker word buried in the middle of it). So a missing `[1m]` does not mean the provider can't handle a big prompt.
- **What `[1m]` actually buys you is Claude Code's own awareness** of that ceiling — the context percentage in the statusline, and, most consequentially, when auto-compact fires. Configure a genuinely-1M-context provider *without* `[1m]` and Claude Code has no way to know it isn't talking to a normal ~200K model; it will compact prematurely on long sessions even though the provider could hold much more.
- **It's a generic suffix match, not a whitelist of Anthropic's own model names.** It fired identically for `moonshotai/kimi-k3[1m]` — an arbitrary third-party ID Claude Code has never heard of — as it does for Anthropic's own native `sonnet-4-6[1m]`/`opus[1m]`-style 1M-beta models (those exist for the real Anthropic API too, and are where this convention originates). Any provider/model name works as the prefix as long as the string ends in exactly `[1m]`.

## Verify the marker on each non-interactive invocation

Keep `[1m]` to select the 1M client budget in the measured `claude --bare -p`
invocation. Capture the exact command before applying this result to
another print-mode or SDK entry point. Use the provider's bare model ID for a
direct API caller that does not perform Claude Code's normalization.

Verified with a local capture server on Claude Code 2.1.263: `--bare -p` configured
with `custom-model[1m]` sends `custom-model` and the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta
header, while its result reports `contextWindow: 1000000`. Configuring the bare
`custom-model` removes that beta header and reports `contextWindow: 200000`.
Removing the suffix therefore changes the client's context budget, even though
the provider receives the same model ID.

Check context-limit overrides on the exact invocation before prescribing them.
In the same `--bare -p` probe, a large input with a bare custom ID failed with
`Prompt is too long`, `duration_api_ms: 0`, and no captured request. Both
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=1000000` and
`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_UNKNOWN_MODEL_WINDOW_ENFORCEMENT=1`, tested separately,
allowed that input to reach the local server. Do not claim the latter is
ineffective on every print-mode path; verify the caller's mode and settings.

Judge `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]` alongside the exit status and captured
request, rather than treating the diagnostic alone as rejection. Successful
isolated probes can emit it; the reported query source can vary, including
`generate_session_title` or `sdk`. Record the actual diagnostic and result of the
invocation under test rather than treating either query-source label as a verdict.

Run the capture recipe below to reproduce model normalization and the reported
client window with an isolated configuration.

## Decision-rule caveat: the step-2-16k war-story

Template bug fixed 2026-07-21 (two layers, caught in two passes): `stepfun.json` originally shipped `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW: "1000000"` on `step-2-16k`. First pass only fixed the internal mismatch (a model whose own name says 16K carrying a 1M claim — a ~60x overclaim, almost certainly left over from copying the deepseek/glm templates without adjusting the number). Second pass caught the deeper problem the first one missed: `step-2-16k` itself is a real but long-superseded model — created 2024-07 per StepFun's own model list, and absent entirely from StepFun's current docs, which describe two live families topped by Step-3.7-Flash (released 2026-05) and Step-3.5-Flash, both **256K context** (verified against StepFun's official docs; a sibling project's own production usage of `step-3.7-flash` independently confirms **262144** as the precise figure). `step-2-16k` had been in this template since the skill's very first commit — it was never checked against StepFun's actual current lineup, just written down as a plausible-looking example. Fixed by switching to `step-3.7-flash` with explicit `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`/`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` set to `262144` (verified, not guessed).

**Lesson for any template in this skill (or any provider config you write from this skill):** an internally-consistent-looking value is not the same as a currently-correct one — cross-check the model name itself against the provider's live docs, not just the numbers around it.

## Verifying an env var actually changes the outgoing request

Not specific to `[1m]` — reach for this any time you need to know whether a Claude Code env var or CLI flag genuinely changes the bytes sent over the wire, versus only affecting Claude Code's own internal bookkeeping. Trusting a template comment, or trusting `--debug api` (internal state only, never the literal request), is how the `[1m]` gap in this skill went unnoticed for as long as it did.

Run this from a shell with Python 3.10+ and `claude` on PATH. It binds an unused
loopback port before launching the client, uses dummy authentication and an empty
configuration directory, disables tools and external MCP configuration, and
removes its temporary configuration when finished. It does not call a real model
provider. The mock response measures client request construction, not a provider's
capacity or real token usage.

```

Keep the command array explicit when adapting this recipe to another invocation.
Change one flag or environment variable at a time, and compare the captured
request, exit status and result's `modelUsage` together. Use a large input when
checking rejection thresholds; the `hi` prompt only tests request construction.
A zero-request failure is evidence of client-side rejection only after the same
server has accepted a control request successfully.
