# directions of drift have happened here for real: a lock-placement fix sat in
# the repo for 26 days while the deployed copy kept running the bug, and two
# cleanup routines written straight into a deployed copy never reached version
# control at all. This installer runs FROM the checkout, so the source is

# sits on, so refuse unless the operator says so explicitly.
