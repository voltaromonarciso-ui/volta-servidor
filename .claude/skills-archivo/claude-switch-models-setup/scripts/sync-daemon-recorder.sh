# Failure recorder for the marketplace skill-source sync daemon.
#
# Problem it solves: the upstream daemon runs under `set -euo pipepipefail` and
# prints its "verified" line only after every step succeeded. A failed pass
# therefore writes NOTHING to source-sync.out.log, so 4000+ lines of "verified"
# are indistinguishable from a healthy run. The traceback does land in
# source-sync.err.log, but nothing reads that file, so a pass can fail every
# 5 minutes for an hour with no signal anywhere.
#
# What this does — and only this: on a non-zero exit, append ONE line
# (timestamp + exit code + the last stderr line THIS pass wrote, or an explicit
# "(no new stderr this pass)" marker when it wrote none) to
# source-sync.failures.log, then re-raise the original exit code so launchd still
# records the failure.
#
# Deliberately absent, per the quiet-watchdog contract (macos-watchdog skill):
#   * no notification      — a log line is a ticket, not a page
#   * no auto-remediation  — nothing here is safe to fix unattended
#   * no repeated lines    — consecutive identical failures collapse to one
#   * bounded log          — rotates at 1 MB, one backup (clause: a recorder
#                            must not itself become the unbounded file)
#
# Premise self-check (clause 1): if the upstream script is gone, say so loudly
# instead of exiting silently — a missing target is exactly the failure mode
# that goes unnoticed for days.
#
# SYNC_TARGET overrides the upstream script so the failure branch can be
# calibrated without breaking the real daemon:
#   SYNC_TARGET=/bin/false bash sync-daemon-recorder.sh
