# Skill Surface Governance Reference

This reference contains the detailed operating procedures for `skill-governance`.
The main Skill is the router. Read only the sections required by the selected
workflow.

## 1. The governed system

Treat these as different layers. A smaller number at one layer is not evidence
that the user's capability surface improved.

| Layer | Question | Typical authority |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical source | Where may the Skill's behavior be edited? | Owned source repo, or the vendor's installed package when no editable source is owned locally |
| Installed inventory | What bundles and versions exist on disk? | Claude plugin metadata/cache, package manager state, or an explicitly managed source inventory |
| Discovery policy | Which installed entries may a host discover? | Claude plugin scope/enabled state; Codex Skill roots and exact-path `skills.config` entries |
| Model-visible catalog | What metadata did a fresh model prompt actually receive? | Fresh-host prompt inspection, never a filesystem count |
| Runtime resources | Which hidden scripts, references, or assets remain reachable? | The selected router's real resolution path and read/run verification |

Keep these distinctions explicit:

1. **Installed is not active.** A bundle may stay on disk while its individual
   entries are hidden behind a router.
2. **Active is not visible.** Config drift or catalog pressure can prevent an
   intended entry from reaching the model.
3. **Visible is not usable.** A router that cannot resolve its cold references
   has made the prompt smaller by deleting capability.
4. **Counts are diagnostics.** The desired result is the intended hot/router
   surface plus reachable cold capability, not the lowest possible count.

## 2. Authority and mutation boundaries

Before changing anything, identify the owner of each layer:

- **Owned Daymade source and activation:** use the current
  `claude-switch-models-setup` source-sync architecture and its explicit
  `codex-active-skills.json`. That manifest owns only source-backed links that
  its syncer manages; it does not own third-party bundles.
- **Claude marketplace/plugin state:** use current `claude plugin marketplace`
  and `claude plugin` commands plus their JSON output. Plugin caches are derived
  runtime state, not a second source repo.
- **Codex user activation:** the current official user root is
  `~/.agents/skills`. `~/.codex/skills` is legacy/system compatibility only
  unless a current local contract explicitly says otherwise.
- **Project Skills:** inspect only the current project's declared
  `.agents/skills` and `.claude/skills` roots.
- **Third-party cold inventory:** the installed bundle remains its own disk
  authority. Exact-path Codex disables control discovery; they do not transfer
  ownership into the source activation manifest.

Mutation rules:

- Audits are read-only.
- Sync, install, uninstall, move, cache repair, config edit, or marketplace
  source change requires an explicit user request covering that action.
- Preserve plugin scope (`user`, `project`, or other current supported scope).
- Never copy an installed/cache tree back over canonical source.
- Never infer that a short, old, duplicated, or hidden Skill has no value. Read
  its scripts, references, assets, and unique behavior first.
- Prefer reversible moves with a manifest over deletion.
- Do not hand-edit Claude plugin cache content as a sync mechanism.
- Do not normalize Claude's cache to one version. Current Claude Code keeps
  versioned entries during its orphan grace period so running sessions can
  finish; official lifecycle cleanup owns that state.

## 3. Establish a bounded baseline

Inspect only the layer implicated by the request. Do not scan unrelated repos.

```bash
codex --version
claude --version
claude plugin marketplace list --json
claude plugin list --json
git -C <canonical-source> status -sb
```

For Codex source-backed activation, inspect the explicit manifest and direct
links rather than counting all directories recursively:

```bash
jq . ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/codex-active-skills.json
find ~/.agents/skills -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type l -print
```

Record:

- requested user-visible entries or routers;
- capabilities that must remain available cold;
- canonical source(s);
- current scope or activation owner;
- exact authorized mutation;
- recovery path and stop condition.

## 4. Audit the real Codex Skill surface

Run from this Skill bundle. The audit is read-only and uses
`codex debug prompt-input` by default:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_codex_skill_surface.py --json
```

Add explicit policy only when the user or current activation SSOT defines it:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_codex_skill_surface.py \
  --require-visible gstack-router \
  --require-visible lark-cli-router \
  --json
```

`--max-visible N` is an optional user policy ceiling, not a built-in quality
score. Use `--prompt-json FILE` for a frozen test fixture.

Read activation manifests through the source owner’s `load_skill_activation_policy`
parser, selected by `--source-sync-script` or its installed default. Keep schema
and field validation with that owner; do not downgrade a manifest to fit the
audit. Missing or incompatible owner code is invalid evidence (exit 2).
Pass the same manifest to the owner’s read-only inventory command. For schema 3,
require inventory schema 2 and use its `selected_skills` identities; do not
resolve `source_preferences` again in the audit. Retain schema 1 inventory
support for older policies, rejecting ambiguous duplicate identities.

The audit asks Codex's own app-server `skills/list` endpoint for the complete,
unshortened metadata parsed from disk, then matches each prompt locator to that
inventory by canonical target while retaining its lexical discovery path for
exact-path policy. It fails invalid if Codex reports any Skill scan error; it
does not maintain a second partial YAML parser. It reports:

- source descriptions that were shortened in the actual prompt;
- descriptions that differ without being a prefix truncation;
- duplicate display identities or distinct sources with the same frontmatter
  name;
- two visible discovery aliases that resolve to the same canonical Skill;
- exact disabled discovery paths that still appear;
- stale disabled paths;
- enabled inventory entries omitted from the initial prompt catalog;
- source-activation names whose direct `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
  entry is missing or not model-visible;
- required routers that are absent;
- an optional visible-count ceiling breach.

Exit status is `0` for clean, `1` for policy pressure/drift, and `2` when the
evidence is invalid. A `1` is not permission to prune; classify each finding and
choose the layer that owns the fix.

Existing sessions retain their startup catalog. Restart Codex and rerun the
audit before claiming that discovery-policy changes took effect.

## 5. Reconcile source-backed activation

Use this workflow for owned source repos managed by
`claude-switch-models-setup`.

1. Read its current source-sync architecture reference and activation manifest.
2. Run its syncer in dry-run mode first. Do not recreate its link logic inside
   this Skill.
3. Use the source owner's validation result to distinguish invalid policy or
   source collisions from unresolved Skill names. Keep unresolved requested
   targets in the expected set; do not remove them to obtain a passing audit.
4. Apply only after the requested active set is explicit.
5. Read back every selected `~/.agents/skills/<name>` link and verify it resolves
   into the declared canonical source.
6. Run the real Codex surface audit. A correct symlink set with a wrong prompt
   catalog is not complete.

The activation manifest is a selection policy. An approved whole marketplace
can be selected without copying its computed membership into a per-Skill list.
Keep the host-specific policy in the source owner's manifest; do not add
third-party cold bundles merely to explain why they exist on disk.

## 6. Keep cold bundles without loading their catalog entries

Use when a bundle's references, scripts, or assets must remain installed while
one router or umbrella Skill should be the model-visible entry.

1. Identify every independently discovered `SKILL.md` in the bounded bundle.
2. Prove which disk resources the router still needs. Record their paths and, for
   generated/vendor mirrors, the appropriate version or digest check.
3. Keep the bundle installed. Do not add it to an owned-source activation
   manifest and do not move it to retirement.
4. Add one exact discovery-path entry for every cold catalog entry to
   `~/.codex/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[skills.config]]
   path = "/absolute/discovery/path/to/SKILL.md"
   enabled = false
   ```

   The path is the discovery path to hide, not necessarily the resolved source
   target. This permits a separately exposed hot symlink to share the same
   source without being disabled accidentally.
5. Do not disable the chosen router.
6. Restart Codex and run the real surface audit with
   `--require-visible <router>`.
7. Exercise one representative cold-resource resolution through the router.

Success requires both: cold entries absent from the model catalog, and the
router still able to reach the retained capability.

## 7. Audit and repair Claude plugin installs

### Read-only audit

1. Resolve the current marketplace source with:

   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace list --json
   ```

2. Resolve installed plugin identity, version, enabled state, and scope with:

   ```bash
   claude plugin list --json
   ```

3. Read the source `marketplace.json`. A top-level plugin with a non-empty
   `skills` array is a suite; compare/install the suite once rather than treating
   its member paths as standalone plugins.
4. Compare canonical source with the installed version while ignoring runtime
   artifacts such as `.git`, `.in_use`, `.security-scan-passed`,
   `.skill-regression-reviewed`, `.orphaned_at`, `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`,
   `.pytest_cache`, `.venv`, `node_modules`, `*.pyc`, and `*.pyo`.
5. Report source drift, version mismatch, missing install, installed identity no
   longer present in the source manifest, and scope mismatch separately.

Discover suites dynamically:

```bash
jq -r '.plugins[] | select(((.skills // []) | length) > 0) | .name' \
  .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```

### Supported repair

1. Update marketplace metadata through the official CLI.
2. Reinstall or update only the affected plugin at its original scope, using the
   commands supported by the current installed Claude version.
3. Verify the installed version and member `SKILL.md` files through independent
   readback.
4. Leave older versioned cache entries to Claude's orphan lifecycle.

### Exceptional manual cache repair

Manual cache removal is not normal governance. Consider it only when current
official loading is demonstrably broken and reinstall/update cannot repair it.
Before any removal:

- identify the exact plugin/version directory;
- prove no required source or unique loose content lives only there;
- account for running sessions that may still reference it;
- create a recoverable copy or move;
- obtain explicit deletion/move authorization;
- repair through the official install path and verify a fresh host.

Never delete every version except the numerically latest as routine hygiene.

### Marketplace source changes

Do not blindly run remove-then-add. Removing a marketplace from its last scope
can uninstall its plugins. For Daymade maintainer local-source switching, route
to the current `claude-switch-models-setup` workflow. For any other marketplace:

1. inventory installed plugins and scopes;
2. freeze the intended replacement source identity;
3. define how installs survive or are restored;
4. perform the source change with current official commands;
5. verify marketplace source, plugin installs, scopes, and a fresh session.

## 8. Reconcile a suite migration

Use only after the canonical marketplace migration has landed. Source topology
design belongs to `marketplace-dev`.

1. Require an explicit mapping from superseded standalone plugin names to the
   replacement suite and invocation names. Do not infer it from basenames.
2. Verify the current source manifest contains the suite, its non-empty `skills`
   array, and every expected member path.
3. Group superseded installs by their existing scope.
4. Update marketplace metadata and install the replacement suite once at each
   required scope.
5. Before uninstalling anything, independently verify:
   - the suite is enabled at that scope;
   - its installed version matches the source manifest;
   - every expected member `SKILL.md` exists;
   - the new namespaced invocation matches the member frontmatter name.
6. Uninstall each superseded standalone identity only after its replacement
   passes all checks.
7. Read back plugin state and, where relevant, the fresh model catalog.

## 9. Audit project dual roots

When the current project exposes both `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills`, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_project_skill_roots.py <project-root> --json
```

The script pairs direct child bundles by frontmatter `name` and returns:

- `canonical_router`: one full canonical bundle plus the exact fail-visible
  compatibility-router contract;
- `shared_target`: both roots resolve to the same canonical bundle;
- `identical_copy`: currently equal but still duplication debt;
- `drift`: divergent full bundles without a valid router;
- `single_root`: one declared root owns the name;
- `invalid`: malformed identity, broken symlink/router, or unauditable root.

Do not infer a router from short length or router-like prose. The accepted router
marker and pointer contract are enforced by the script. Choosing the canonical
owner and replacing a copy remains a repository-owner decision.

## 10. Retire a loose or duplicate Skill without losing value

Bound the scan to direct entries in the implicated roots. For a user-surface
request, check the requested subset of `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`,
and legacy `~/.codex/skills`; when the user asks to unify or clean the whole user
surface, these roots are implicated. Before classification, read each root's
current package-manager ownership record, including the adjacent
`.skill-lock.json` when present, current Claude plugin metadata, and any explicit
source activation manifest. An unreadable or unfamiliar lock schema is
`Unknown`, not permission to move its entries. Then classify each candidate:

- **Managed source link:** owned by a current activation manifest; reconcile via
  its syncer.
- **Lock-managed direct Skill:** present in the current `.skill-lock.json`; use
  that manager's uninstall/update workflow and do not move the directory.
- **Plugin-managed:** owned by installed plugin metadata; use official plugin
  operations.
- **Third-party cold inventory:** kept on disk and hidden through discovery
  policy; do not retire it.
- **Source-backed duplicate:** behavior matches a canonical source; replace with
  the canonical link/install only after readback.
- **Loose but valuable:** unique methodology, scripts, references, assets,
  credential flow, or domain knowledge; migrate it to a source owner before
  removing the active copy.
- **Superseded or valueless duplicate:** no unique capability remains and a
  verified replacement exists; eligible for reversible retirement.
- **Unknown:** ownership or unique value is unresolved; keep it active or cold
  and report the blocker.

For a retire candidate:

1. Re-read lock, plugin, and activation ownership immediately before mutation.
   Any ownership match or unresolved schema aborts the move.
2. Capture path, frontmatter identity, file list, executable bits, and hashes.
3. Record the verified replacement or the evidence that no unique capability
   exists.
4. Move the complete bundle to a dated `retired-skills/<reason>-<date>/`
   location under the same owning profile or another user-approved recoverable
   destination. Do not use `rm -rf`.
5. Verify the replacement first, then verify the retired copy and its manifest.
6. Restart the affected host and inspect its actual catalog.

Do not keep a misleading retired rules snapshot in the active tree merely for
history. Git history or the retirement artifact is the historical record.

## 11. Verify the user-visible outcome

Verification follows the changed layer:

1. **Source:** diff and focused tests prove the intended behavior remains.
2. **Installed state:** official list JSON plus filesystem readback proves
   identity, version, scope, and member files.
3. **Discovery:** config/link readback proves the selected paths and policy.
4. **Catalog:** a fresh prompt audit records the visible entries, omissions, and
   description truncation. Apply the metadata requirements of the requested
   surface; the installation-only target gate in §14 does not certify the whole
   catalog's description quality.
5. **Cold capability:** one representative router action proves hidden resources
   remain reachable.
6. **Recovery:** any retired/moved material and its hashes remain present.

Stop when the requested surface and retained capabilities are proven. Do not add
another governance layer merely because one more metric could be produced.

## 12. Report format

Report decisions rather than dumping every directory:

```markdown
# Skill Governance Result

## Requested outcome
- Intended visible entries/routers: ...
- Capabilities retained cold: ...

## Authority used
- Canonical source: ...
- Activation/discovery SSOT: ...
- Installed-state authority: ...

## Findings
| Layer | Finding | Evidence | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|

## Changes made
- ...

## Independent readback
- Fresh catalog: ...
- Cold capability probe: ...
- Recovery path: ...

## Remaining unknowns or exceptions
- ...
```

Do not persist derived totals as governance truth. Compute them from the current
audit when the user asks.

## 13. Troubleshooting

- **Filesystem count differs from the prompt:** expected; inspect the discovery
  policy and fresh prompt. Disk inventory is not the catalog.
- **A source description is truncated:** report the observed loss separately
  from target availability. Change catalog selection only within the user's
  declared policy; a full-marketplace decision is not permission to prune it.
  Use actual task results when assessing whether truncation caused a failure.
- **The prompt and `skills/list` disagree:** treat the audit as invalid or
  pressure according to the reported field. Do not fall back to a hand-written
  YAML approximation.
- **A disabled source still appears through a hot alias:** exact-path policy is
  lexical. Disable the discovery path to hide, not every symlink resolving to
  the same source.
- **A router remains but its child action fails:** the cold bundle or version
  parity was lost. Restore the resource before calling consolidation complete.
- **Old Claude cache versions remain:** this can be normal orphan grace for
  running sessions. Do not clean them solely to make a count reach one.
- **Marketplace remove would affect installs:** stop and design a scope-preserving
  migration; do not rely on remove-then-add.

- **A duplicate is byte-identical:** it is duplication debt, not evidence that
  either copy can be deleted without identifying the owner and replacement.
- **Current session still shows retired entries:** restart; startup metadata is
  not retroactively rewritten.

## 14. Verify a newly registered Skill

Use this gate when the requested delivery includes local availability. Take the
expected identity from the task's new registration, not from the current active
list. A source-only or package-only delivery does not authorize local activation.

1. Run the source owner's sync dry-run and apply within the declared host policy.
   An approved whole marketplace automatically includes new members. Keep explicit
   cold discovery paths and router contracts; absence alone is not a cold decision.
2. Read back the installed route. Codex needs the correct source link. Claude can
   use either its personal Skill or an enabled plugin containing that Skill;
   absence from plugin install JSON alone does not prove a personal Skill missing.
3. Run the fresh-host checks from this bundle:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/audit_codex_skill_surface.py --require-visible <skill-name> --required-only --json
   python3 scripts/audit_claude_skill_surface.py --require-visible <command-name> --json
   ```

   Use Claude's exact personal name or its existing `<plugin>:<skill>` command.
   The Claude probe sends only an initialization control request, with no user
   turn and a loopback model endpoint. Invocation-only settings disable hooks and
   MCP servers while keeping Skill/plugin discovery. It proves command discovery,
   not model auto-triggering or successful Skill execution. `--catalog-jsonl` reads
   a frozen initialization fixture; use a live probe for a live delivery claim.
4. Require exit 0 for each requested target. Missing names exit 1; invalid or
   unavailable evidence exits 2. Codex `--required-only` gates the explicit target
   names and their source-link identity while retaining unrelated catalog pressure
   in the JSON report. A visible name from the wrong source still fails. For a
   whole-host audit, omit it: the audit expands `active_marketplaces` through the
   source owner's `--print-source-inventory` resolver. `--source-sync-script`
   selects that resolver; `--source-inventory-json` supplies a frozen fixture.
5. For a retained cold entry, prove it stays absent at each exact discovery alias
   and that its router still resolves a representative resource. Codex exact-path
   disables apply only to those lexical paths, not to new aliases of the source.

Do not use `skill-install-audit.py` exit 0 as this gate: it is an inventory report,
can contain findings, and does not measure the fresh host catalog. Stop when the
requested host discovers the target and the retained cold route still works.

### Task behavior when it is part of delivery

Use the concrete requested task and check its returned material or state against
an independent source. Keep the real read-only execution path available: a probe
that excludes the Skill's script runner cannot establish how the ordinary
workflow behaves. State any probe-only tool, hook, or MCP restrictions alongside
the result.

Record whether the host selected the Skill, completed the task, and returned a
correct result as separate observations. A correct answer obtained through other
tools is not by itself an installation defect; it also does not prove automatic
Skill invocation. An unavailable provider or unfinished model request leaves the
behavior check unverified. Do not rerun a passing task or add a description-tuning
workflow unless a new failure or changed requirement calls for it.

## 15. Decide model-visible vs user-invocable-only from usage evidence

Use before setting or removing `skillOverrides: "user-invocable-only"` (or
`disable-model-invocation`) for one Skill or a batch. The description, the
install location, and "it looks niche" are not evidence. What decides is how the
Skill has been used and who started it.

A user-invocable-only Skill leaves the model's catalog **and** refuses every
model call, including a call made right after the user named the Skill in
prose. Only the user typing `/name` still works. So the question per Skill is:
does anyone other than a typed slash command start it?

1. Build or refresh the usage ledger owned by `read-claude-code-history`:

   ```bash
   python3 <read-claude-code-history>/scripts/skill_usage_ledger.py index
   python3 <read-claude-code-history>/scripts/skill_usage_ledger.py report <names...> --since <date> --until <day-hidden> --json
   ```

   It covers every registered Claude home and archive plus Codex. Read its
   `status` coverage limits before concluding anything from zero. Identities
   are install names: a Codex read of an installed Skill's real file carries the
   name it is installed under (`suite:skill` for a nested bundle), and reads of
   worktrees, snapshots and temporary copies are already excluded. If a row's
   `identities` holds more than one name, rerun with `--exact` and judge the row
   for the entry the override governs — the bare name for a personal Skill.
2. Separate router children first. A Skill whose visible router reads its
   `SKILL.md` stays cold whatever its count: the router is its model entry.
   Confirm the router itself is model-visible and actually names the child.
3. Keep model-visible when any of these holds in the last 90 days:
   - Claude model-initiated use (`model_named` or `model_auto`) at least once
     while the Skill was visible — pass `--until` the day it was hidden;
   - Codex model-initiated use at least three times (Codex never sees Claude's
     overrides, so its window runs to today; `dev_read` and `bulk_read` are
     already excluded);
   - any `blocked` call — the model reached for it after it was hidden;
   - a global or project `CLAUDE.md`, hook injection text, or a visible Skill
     tells the model to use it ("走 X" / "invoke X" / "X owns …"). A mention
     that only points at a file path to read, or uses the code as a library,
     does not count.
4. Otherwise it may go user-invocable-only: all recorded starts are typed slash
   commands, or there is no recorded use in the covered stores.
5. Before trusting a count, look at where it came from: `sqlite3` the ledger's
   `events` table for that Skill's `session_id` and `origin`. Counts spread over
   many sessions are use. Counts packed into one or two sessions are often
   someone building or reviewing the Skill through its installed path — open
   one of those sessions before letting them decide. When a session still does
   not say which, keep the Skill visible: a wrongly visible Skill costs one
   catalog line, a wrongly hidden one makes every model call fail.
6. Back up `settings.json`, apply, and prove one restored Skill with a real model
   `Skill` call in the current session (overrides apply without restart).

Record the thresholds, the per-Skill decision, and the backup path in the change
report. Never hide a batch selected by install location, marketplace, or name
pattern without running steps 1–5 on each member.


## 16. Audit an explicit delivery contract

Read the original user requirement before accepting the contract's outcome, scope and source owner. Author-supplied tests or a self-written contract cannot establish that this is what the user requested.

Run from this skill-governance directory, or use the script's absolute path:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_skill_delivery.py <skill-path> --delivery-contract <private-contract.json> --json
```

The private JSON object requires integer `schema_version: 1`, non-empty `user_outcome`, `scope` (`marketplace` or `project`), `source_repo`, and `skill_name`. Optional `installed_path` and `inventory` are non-empty path strings; inventory uses the source owner's schema. `installed_path` checks a source-backed alias resolving to the declared source directory; it is not a validator for an ordinary versioned plugin copy. Use §7 for that copy's installation lifecycle and §14 for host verification. Omitted installation evidence remains unknown. Keep private paths and requirements outside the distributed Skill bundle.

The adapter invokes sibling `skill-creator/scripts/source_contract.py audit` for all source, registration and link rules; it adds no source whitelist. Inspect its `source_audit` checks individually. A runnable, discoverable Skill stored outside the contracted source repo fails delivery. Project scope uses its declared project owner rather than a global marketplace requirement. Quality-only external reviews need no delivery contract.

Exit 2 means invalid delivery evidence, exit 1 means unknown. The adapter's static source result is `static_status`; overall delivery stays unknown until independent evidence establishes the original requirement and requested current host result. This command does not probe a host and never reports current loading as verified. For that claim, run §14's applicable fresh-host checks and, when requested, its task behavior probe. Preserve source, registration, installation and current host evidence as separate observations.
