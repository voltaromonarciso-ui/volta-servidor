# Independent Review Protocol

The operational detail behind standing discipline #5. SKILL.md carries the rules and the
pass/fail criteria; this file carries the reasoning, the worked cases, and the exact
procedure. Read it the first time you run an independent pass, and any time a pass returns
something you are tempted to argue with.

## Why self-review cannot substitute

Your "it's good now" judgment runs on the same model that produced the artifact, so it
shares the exact blind spots that produced the defect. This is measured, not folklore:
intrinsic self-correction without external feedback does not reliably improve output and
sometimes degrades it ([Huang et al., ICLR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798)). The
same model corrects the *identical* error readily when it arrives in someone else's input.
And when generator and evaluator share error modes, iterating **raises confidence without
adding information** — the output is a polished, confidently wrong artifact. Adding *more*
self-checks does not escape that; only an outside view does.

## The two faces of independence

Most authors get the first one right and never notice the second.

| Face | What fails without it | Typical mistake |
|---|---|---|
| **The reviewer's context** | It inherits your blind spots and returns a "reviewed" stamp | Using a fork of your own context |
| **The evidence it measures against** | It inherits your *conclusion* — it reads an artifact and a spec that already agree, and reports agreement | Handing it a record you edited during this work |

### Worked case: a natural controlled experiment

Three independent agents read one diff. They caught a clause that reversed a dated,
attributed decision — and missed a **second, same-shaped reversal** a few clauses away.

The only difference between the two: the first decision's record was untouched, while the
second's had been edited by the author the previous day to declare the original decision
superseded. So the reviewers read an artifact and a record that already agreed.

**Same reviewers, same defect class, one visible and one invisible; the only variable was
whether the author had written to the evidence.**

Two things follow. First, "not edited in this session" is too weak a line — that record was
poisoned the *previous* day and would have passed such a test. The correct line is **outside
the change's blast radius**. Second, the failure is invisible from the inside by
construction: every reviewer downstream of a poisoned record reports agreement, and the
report is indistinguishable from a genuine one.

### Choosing an anchor

Rank candidates by how structurally hard they are for *you* to have touched:

1. **The user's own words in the transcript.** You cannot edit them. Looks like the weakest
   anchor because it is informal; it is in fact the strongest.
2. **A git ref predating the whole line of work** — verified, not assumed:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline <ref>..HEAD -- <path>    # any commit of yours ⇒ not an anchor
   ```
3. **An append-only decision log.** "Append-only" is a convention, not an enforcement.
   Check its history the same way before trusting it.

**Greenfield has no anchor, and pretending otherwise is the failure mode.** A brand-new
skill has no prior ref and no log, and the transcript *is* your input — an artifact agreeing
with it is the design goal, not evidence. Say so, name what could not be checked, and ask
the user for the missing anchor rather than reporting an independent pass you did not run.

## Writing the reviewer prompt

Give it **exactly two evidence-bearing inputs**: the immutable artifact and the reader spec.
Also provide three non-evidentiary control fields: the current change's blast radius, named
failure axes, and terminal condition. These fields constrain what the pass may inspect and
when it stops; they do not assert that the implementation is correct. Give no design rationale,
project background, or "just confirm X is fine." A leading prompt converts an independent
reviewer into a rubber stamp.

### The reader spec

State who the target reader is and what they already know. This is a *specification*, not
rationale: it says nothing about what you built or why, so it cannot rubber-stamp anything.
Omitting it wastes half the pass — without it the reviewer measures against *itself*, a blank
slate, and returns a flood of "who is this person, what does this product name mean" that
buries the findings which hold for the real reader.

| Artifact | Reader spec | The reader's failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| A document / report | *"The reader owns this project and knows the product names and the people involved; they have not seen this particular work."* | "I don't know this word" |
| **A SKILL.md** (the main case here — its primary reader is another Claude instance executing it) | *"You are an agent about to perform &lt;task&gt;. You know the general tooling but nothing about this project's history."* | "I don't know which tool to call or what to produce" |

Ask an agent-reader which **instructions it could not act on**, not which words it did not
recognize.

**State the reader spec before the run and never use it afterwards to explain findings away.**
Post-hoc "my reader already knows that" is precisely how an author discards the findings that
hurt.

### What to ask

Only what the reviewer can directly observe:

- Which sentences could you not act on?
- What contradicts what?
- What does this claim exists that does not?
- Where would you get stuck?

Never *"confirm that X is fine."*

### Changed operating defaults and thresholds

Within an already-required review, examine a changed operating default or threshold
against the original business request separately from its implementation. Distinguish
explicit user or domain contracts from reversible assumptions; check whether the
business acceptance criterion and relevant workload/cost evidence support the
choice, or name the missing basis. Passing value tests proves implementation compliance, not
that the chosen value suits the task. Add this question to the existing bounded
pass; it does not create another review obligation.

## Interpreting what comes back

| Finding type | Authority | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Comprehensibility** ("I could not follow this") | **Ground truth.** It literally is the naive reader; there is no arguing with it. | Apply directly |
| **Completeness against a corpus** ("the sources contain X, the skill does not") | **Ground truth** — objective anchor: is it in the sources? | Verify the citation, then apply |
| "This might be a bug / I'd suggest Y" | Hypothesis | Reproduce it yourself before acting |
| Taste, "AI slop", aesthetics | **None** — same-model blind spot | Do not delegate this at all |

The line between legitimate filtering and discarding what hurts is the written record: a
finding you reject leaves a reason in the review file (below). A rejection with no written
reason is how an author quietly drops the inconvenient ones.

## Choosing the axes, and how many reviewers

**The axis is the question you ask; the area is the material you read.** Three reviewers
covering scenarios, arithmetic, and the diff but all asking "is this internally consistent?"
is one reviewer billed three times.

**One reviewer is the default and frequently sufficient.** In one run a single fresh pass
caught a hard arithmetic contradiction — one card asserting 4 items while two other sections
independently computed 10 — that the author's own six-item self-check gate had just certified
green, plus two captions on the same image stating different counts. Both defects were
authored by the person who had just verified them.

Add a reviewer only to cover an **additional axis**, never to re-ask the same question.
Common axes, and the one that matters most:

| Axis | The question |
|---|---|
| Coherence | Does this hang together? |
| **Fidelity** | **Is this still faithful to commitments already made?** |
| Completeness | Is anything in the sources missing here? |
| Comprehensibility | Could a naive reader act on this? |
| Public-distribution privacy | Do concrete examples, identifiers or incident details disclose private source material? |
| Dependency availability | Can the intended reader obtain and use each helper required by the changed instructions? |

**Fidelity is the axis self-review is structurally worst at**, because the author is the one
who moved the commitment. Coherence and fidelity are orthogonal: an artifact can be flawlessly
self-consistent while being completely unfaithful to what was already decided. If you run a
second reviewer at all, make it the fidelity one — and hand it the out-of-blast-radius anchor,
or it will simply re-derive your conclusion from your own record.

## Freeze scope and the stopping rule before review

An adversarial reviewer is deliberately good at finding more work. Without a frozen boundary,
each genuine finding becomes permission to inspect a wider subsystem, and “verify this edit”
quietly turns into “redesign everything the artifact has ever done.” That is not rigor; it is
an unapproved scope change whose completion condition moves after every pass.

Freeze these five fields before dispatch and include all five in the reviewer prompt. The first
two are evidence-bearing inputs; the last three are review-control metadata, not evidence for
the author's conclusion:

1. **Immutable artifact** — exact file set or commit/ref being judged.
2. **Reader spec** — who must execute it and what they already know.
3. **Change blast radius** — capabilities, rules, scripts, and runtime paths this edit touched or newly advertised.
4. **Failure axes** — the bounded questions this pass must answer.
5. **Terminal condition** — for example: no unresolved BLOCKER/MAJOR on those axes, deterministic gates pass, and every old scenario has a classified disposition.

### Public-distribution axes

For a public Skill change, include privacy and dependency availability in the
existing required pass. Use [the sanitization checklist](sanitization_checklist.md#trace-examples-and-verify-required-helpers)
for the checks; do not limit the privacy read to scanner hits. Bind the artifact
input to the exact candidate and public files declared for this pass; verify helper
availability against the actual distributed file set. Include source locators
for changed examples in that input, with private originals outside the public
tree and available only within authorized scope. A locator or author assertion
does not prove that its source is public or its replacement is synthetic.

The reviewer checks the cited source or reports the provenance gap, and checks
required helpers against the distributed files or declared dependency interface.
Record the inspected files, source dispositions and representative dependency
observations in the private review artifact. Missing source context can be
resolved with a synthetic equivalent; an unavailable runtime check remains in
Not checked. Do not call that check passed. This adds questions to the existing
pass, not another reviewer or an unbounded audit of unrelated historical content.

Triage each finding by causal relationship to the current change:

| Finding relationship | Current-release disposition |
|---|---|
| The edit caused the defect, removed its old exit, widened exposure, contradicted the new contract, or newly promised that the affected helper/path was safe | **In scope.** Reproduce and fix or explicitly change the plan with user approval |
| The defect predates the edit unchanged, the edited runtime path does not rely on it, and no new claim elevates it | **Pre-existing / out of scope.** Record as a backlog hypothesis; do not silently absorb it into this task |
| The relationship is unclear | Run the cheapest ref/diff/scenario check that separates the rows; uncertainty is not permission to expand scope |

After a substantive fix, use a new fresh-context reviewer, but ask it to recheck the failed
axes and verify no regression against the same immutable anchor. Do not reset the audit to an
unbounded whole-artifact hunt unless the fix actually broadened the blast radius or the user
explicitly expands the assignment.

Stop when the declared terminal condition is met. Minor improvements and unrelated historical
defects can remain recorded without blocking release. If the user says to stop reviewing or
ship now, open no new axes; finish the already-declared release gate and report any unresolved
in-scope BLOCKER/MAJOR rather than hiding it. This boundary limits scope, not honesty.

## The convergence protocol — decide the stop BEFORE the first round

An adversarial reviewer's hole-finding rate does not decay on its own. In a real five-round hardening of a mechanical gate checker, rounds 2/3/4 each produced roughly 13 blocking findings. **The count is not the convergence signal; the shape is.** Round 1 found "the gate has no mechanical enforcement at all" (the core promise); round 4 found "swap two table columns and the fabricated quote is never checked" (a parser edge a real executing agent is unlikely to write). When findings degrade from core-promise violations to parser edges, the loop has converged — further rounds buy diminishing and increasingly contrived returns, while the author's time and the user's patience pay full price each round.

Before the first round, state the endgame rule in the plan and in the reviewer prompts' terminal-condition field:

1. **The stop rule, declared in advance.** E.g. "if a core-promise-class hole recurs, one bounded fix round follows, then ship regardless; everything else is recorded as accepted recurrence." An open-ended "iterate until clean" is unfalsifiable: any finite prefix of rounds can be extended by "one more", so the criterion must be declared before the first round or it will never be met. (The user's own governance rule — third recurrence of a class gets either a mechanical detector or an explicit "prose has no fix, accept recurrence" record — is the same shape.) The host may already have fixed this for you: a review loop, hook-enforced or agent-driven, carries a `BUDGET` set before the first cycle (see the Loop Contract in the `claude-code-hooks` skill's rule 7). Read the budget before dispatching the first reviewer; once it is spent, a further reviewer is a new user-authorized task rather than a continuation, and what was not independently re-reviewed goes into the review file's "not covered" section as the capped exit.
2. **Probe corpus conversion after every fix round.** That round's adversarial probes become the regression corpus: attack probes assert the post-fix exit, controls assert the compliant shape still passes. Copy them into the bundle (sanitized — and sanitize to the detector's *pattern*, not to a different literal) so `unittest discover` re-runs the whole bidirectional calibration in one command. A probe that lives only in `/tmp` between rounds is a calibration that can evaporate — one session's corpus was wiped by the system between rounds and only survived because the previous round had already copied it into the bundle.
3. **"0 new blocking" is a valid and valuable conclusion — say so in the reviewer prompt.** A reviewer that feels obliged to manufacture findings is worse than one that reports a clean pass; the finding that matters is the reproducible one. Pair it with the honest boundary: name the construction directions it tried and why it believes they are covered.
4. **The recorded residual is the sanctioned exit, not a failure.** What the checker structurally cannot decide — whether a quoted "user direction" was really the user's words, whether claimed never-used evidence is true — goes into the review artifact's honest-limits section with a human-spot-check note. Shipping with a recorded residual beats an unbounded review loop; the record is what makes the residual auditable instead of forgotten.

## The corpus case

When a skill is built by distilling a large source corpus (docs, transcripts, prior research),
the compression model that dropped content is the same one now judging completeness — so
self-review, *including your own grep*, systematically misses the same-*type* gaps.

Run a fresh subagent over all the source material **plus** the finished skill; have it
adversarially list what is absent or materially thinner, with source citations, ranked by
load-bearingness. Evidence: in one build the author declared "complete" twice and both times
more surfaced; the independent audit then found 15 further genuine gaps, including a
load-bearing operational mechanism the skill kept referencing but never showed how to do.

## The review file

Write `independent-review.md` under `skill-reviews/<skill-name>/` in your private, git-tracked knowledge repo, **and commit it there in the same turn** — a file sitting uncommitted in a git working directory carries none of the "git-tracked" guarantee this rule exists for; `ls`/`test -f` confirms it's on disk, not that it survives to the next session. If you don't know which repo that is (or don't have one), say so and ask the user — do not guess a location that lands in either forbidden zone. That repo's own commit hook may also restrict where such files may live (a structure guard may reject the path and name the directory it allows); read the hook's message and move the file there rather than bypassing the hook. Two forbidden locations: **NOT** in `<skill-name>-workspace/` (gitignored scratch dirs that get wiped — this file is cross-session review evidence and must survive them) and **NOT** in any repo that is or may become public or distributed — which normally rules out the reviewed skill's own repo (review content inherently quotes private paths, real names, and project details):

**When the reviewed change ships in the public `claude-code-skills` repo, the archive carries one more receipt.** That repo's pre-push gate (its `scripts/ci/check_skill_release.py`, outside this skill) only lets the push through when the review archive contains exactly one `<!-- skill-release-review` block holding a passed JSON receipt for the exact published head (40-char `candidate`) and skill scope — write it as `{"schema": 1, "result": "passed", "candidate": "<head>", "skill_paths": ["<skill-dir>"]}` and keep the authoritative field list with `release_readiness.py`'s validation, not this example. Amend or rebase the release commit and the block's `candidate` must be refreshed before `release_readiness.py attest` will bind it. Learning this from the gate's error at push time costs two extra round-trips (2026-10-06: attest refused, gate source read, block added, archive re-committed, attest re-run); write the block when the archive is drafted and update the candidate at attest time.

```markdown
# Independent review — <artifact>, <date>

## Reviewer prompt (verbatim)
<paste exactly what you sent, so a later reader can judge whether it was leading>

## Reader spec given
<the spec, stated before the run>

## Findings
| # | Finding | Type | Disposition | Reason |
|---|---------|------|-------------|--------|

## Not checked
<anything you could not anchor — greenfield gaps, missing sources>
```

Three properties earn their keep: the **verbatim prompt** exposes a leading question; the
**disposition column** makes filtering auditable; the **not-checked section** stops an
incomplete pass from being reported as a clean one.

Re-review with a **new** agent after a substantive edit — the one that just reviewed is no
longer independent of what it reviewed. *Substantive* = you changed a rule, a contract, or a
number; not a typo or a rewording that leaves every instruction identical.
