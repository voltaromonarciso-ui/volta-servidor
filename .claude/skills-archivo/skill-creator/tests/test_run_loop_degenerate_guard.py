"""Regression suite for run_loop.py's degenerate-harness / infra-error guard.

Everything here mocks run_eval/improve_description — no real `claude -p` subprocess calls,
so this suite is fast, deterministic, and free to run on every change to run_loop.py or
generate_report.py. That matters here specifically: the guard exists to stop a loop that
burns real API calls against a broken measurement, so its own test suite burning real API
calls would be the same mistake one layer up.

NOTE: this directory is not currently wired into scripts/ci/test-suites.txt (see that
file's admission criteria) — run locally with:
    uv run --frozen python -m pytest tests/test_run_loop_degenerate_guard.py -q
