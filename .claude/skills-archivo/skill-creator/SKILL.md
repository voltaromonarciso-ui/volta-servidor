# Skill Creator

A skill for creating new skills and iteratively improving them.

When loading this file through an output-limited shell tool, use the complete-read
recipe in [stateful script verification](references/stateful-script-verification.md#complete-file-reads).
A truncated response does not count as loading the missing text.

At a high level, the process of creating a skill goes like this:

- Decide what you want the skill to do and roughly how it should do it
- Classify the change into the lowest verification tier that can falsify its likely failure modes
- Write a draft of the skill
- Validate with the smallest evidence that can falsify the changed behavior; treat the full paired eval pipeline as separately authorized work, not an automatic consequence of a tier label
- Help the user evaluate qualitative or quantitative results when the selected tier produces them
- Present the finished outcome in a form the user can inspect; use a visual report only when it makes evidence, comparisons, or decisions clearer than a concise reply
- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)
- Repeat until you're satisfied
- Escalate the verification tier only when the current evidence cannot resolve the changed behavior

Your job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through the applicable stages. Full A/B benchmarking is a capability, not a tax on every edit. Words such as "optimize", "improve", or "comprehensive" describe intent, not failure surface or evaluation budget. Do not create eval files, fan out paired agents, grade outputs, or launch a viewer merely because a task sounds broad or a long conversation precedes it.

Standing disciplines apply throughout, because these failure modes ship convincing-looking skills that are wrong:

1. **Verify before you write.** Every technical assertion that enters the skill (endpoint, parameter, command, version, behavior) must trace to something you executed and observed — in this session or an explicitly approved mined one. Can't verify it right now? Either go verify it, or mark it explicitly ("unverified — from memory"). A skill multiplies whatever it contains: verified knowledge compounds, and so do confidently-stated errors. For knowledge skills (content is mostly facts about an external system — API endpoints, parameters, fields, platform behavior), read [references/knowledge-skill-grounding.md](references/knowledge-skill-grounding.md) for the operational version: the authority ladder (observed behavior > machine-readable contract > exercised production code > official docs > memory), evidence-scope annotation and live/replay/synthetic evidence tiers, pre-ship doc-example smoke runs, and the audience/Windows portability checklist. A source-grounding audit once found multiple confident contract claims that contradicted evidence already available to the author (methodology Case 9). **A "landed" claim is verified against the target ref, not the commit message.** When a commit message, changelog entry, or skill section asserts a capability was implemented/fixed/landed, the assertion is not evidence — before reporting it done, and again before any later session builds on it, grep the *target ref itself* (`git show <ref>:<path>`) for that capability's signature strings and read the key lines back. Real incident (2026-09-17): a commit message claimed a voice-input chain had been rewritten to a single-click model, while the pushed ref still carried the hold-to-talk model — only a post-compaction grep of the actual ref caught it. The commit message, the changelog entry, and the author's summary are one source; counting them as three is exactly how such a claim survives review. Criterion: every capability named in the claim has its implementation signature present in the target ref, read from the ref.
2. **Treat "impossible / not supported" as a hypothesis, not a conclusion.** When a capability seems blocked (an API error wall, a tool that won't connect, a format that won't open), exhaust the observation paths — the UI's own network traffic, an alternative channel, a different documented identifier — before writing "the platform doesn't support this" into a skill. Observed behavior outranks speculative request shapes.
3. **Stand on the field's shoulders — retrieve the domain's established best-practices into context BY DEFAULT, before authoring or optimizing a skill's methodology.** A skill's methodology is only as good as the knowledge in your context window, not the knowledge latent in your weights: pretraining is lossy, goes stale, and often is not even activated unless the canonical sources are actually pulled in. So the quality ceiling of what you write is `your training data + the user's input` — *unless* you deliberately retrieve the subject domain's real prior art. Do it: WebSearch the field's canonical theory / standards / methods, and read any bundled or installed skill in that domain, then fold the load-bearing principles into the skill with attribution. **This is a different axis from "Prior Art Research" below** — that finds *tools/infrastructure* to reuse; this grounds the *quality of the methodology itself* in the discipline's accumulated science. Make it the **default action, not something you wait to be asked for**: briefly tell the user which field you're pulling from and let them say "skip," but never ship a methodology capped by your memory plus their prompt when 40 years of the field's public work is one search away. Examples: a data-visualization skill must absorb Cleveland & McGill's graphical-perception ranking and Bertin's visual variables (position/length beat color beat text — measured, not aesthetic); a date/time skill must surface the mature libraries and their canonical pitfalls; a persuasion/negotiation skill must retrieve the established frameworks rather than reinvent them from memory. If the canonical knowledge lives only in your weights and never enters context, you are guessing where you could be citing.
4. **Preserve before you compress an existing skill.** Updating an existing skill is a migration, not a blank-page rewrite. Before the first edit, capture the auditable source bundle with the audit tool's `snapshot` command, or reconstruct it from an explicit Git ref; an arbitrary copy plus a provenance label is not a baseline. Inventory runtime capabilities, trigger contexts, interfaces, references, and eval coverage. Progressive disclosure and concision authorize moving or deduplicating content; they do not authorize silently deleting behavior. After editing, run `scripts/audit_skill_regression.py` and classify every unmatched old unit. A runtime contract that survives only in `evals/`, tests, or an unlinked reference is still lost. Do not call the update complete while any candidate is unclassified or any true gap remains unfixed. The same logic governs *reversals*, not just deletions, and covers any prior commitment — not only the ones carrying a date and a name: **overturning a decision already made is a proposal, never a side effect.** Say it out loud and get it accepted. A silent rewrite is worse than a silent deletion, because it destroys the artifact and the evidence that could have caught it in one move — and it blinds every downstream reviewer (see #5).

   **Classify each intended delta before editing; “compression” is a claim of behavioral equivalence, not a synonym for “shorter.”** For every old user scenario, a fresh agent must still be able to find the trigger, decision inputs, supported action, stop/confirmation point, impact/recovery boundary, and verification path. Use these names as a separate change-type label in the plan, review, and changelog; record the label in each regression candidate's reason/semantic review while keeping the audit tool's `disposition` field to the exact Step 4 enum:

   | Change type | Definition | Required handling |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Lossless compression** | Only representation changes: relocate detail into a directly reachable bundled reference, deduplicate against a packaged canonical source, or shorten wording while preserving every runtime contract above | May be called compression; prove scenario reachability, not just string survival |
   | **Capability retirement** | A previously executable job or action is no longer available | Not compression; name the retired capability, obtain traceable user approval, and publish the boundary |
   | **Scope narrowing / boundary change** | Fewer inputs, targets, environments, or modes remain supported; an execution branch becomes analysis-only | Not compression even when safer; surface and publish the boundary/trade-off, then obtain traceable approval unless the user already requested this exact narrowing |
   | **Workflow or safety redesign** | Commands, sequence, confirmation, side effects, recovery, or success checks materially change | Not compression; surface the new contract and trade-off, obtain traceable approval unless the user already requested this exact redesign, then verify it independently of preservation |
   | **Bug fix / factual correction** | The implementation or prose is brought back to an explicit existing contract or current authority | Not compression; use the narrow authority or deterministic regression that decides it |
   | **Lossy summarization** | Exact conditions, commands, decision semantics, or execution exits disappear without a runtime-reachable equivalent | Regression, not optimization; restore it or reclassify it through an approved row above |

   Deduplication counts as lossless only when the canonical source ships with or is reliably available to the skill **and** SKILL.md tells the runtime reader when to load it. “The idea still exists in tests, a changelog, an installed sibling skill, or the author's memory” is not compression. If one patch contains several types, list them separately; never let the compression label launder a retirement or redesign.

5. **Nothing ships on self-review alone — an independent, fresh-context adversarial pass is a standing step, not a special case.** Your "it's good now" judgment runs on the same model that produced the artifact, so it shares the exact blind spots that produced the defect. Measured, not folklore: intrinsic self-correction without external feedback does not reliably improve output and sometimes degrades it (Huang et al., ICLR 2024), and when generator and evaluator share error modes, iterating **raises confidence without adding information**. More self-checks cannot escape that; only an outside view can. **Full procedure — prompt templates, anchor selection, the findings table, worked cases — in [references/independent-review-protocol.md](references/independent-review-protocol.md); read it before your first pass.** The load-bearing rules:
   - **Independence has two faces, and the second one is the one authors miss.** The *reviewer's context* must not be a fork of yours — a fork inherits your blind spots and hands back a "reviewed" stamp. But the *evidence it measures against* must also sit **outside the change's blast radius**, or it inherits your **conclusion**: it reads an artifact and a spec that already agree, and reports agreement. Note "not edited this session" is too weak a line — in the reference's controlled case the poisoned record was edited the *previous* day, and three reviewers went blind to a defect they caught in its untouched twin. Rank anchors by how hard they are for *you* to have touched: the user's own transcript words > a git ref predating the work (`git log --oneline <ref>..HEAD -- <path>`; any commit of yours disqualifies it) > an append-only log (a convention, not an enforcement). **Greenfield has no anchor — say so and ask for one rather than reporting a pass you did not run.**
   - **Give it exactly two evidence-bearing inputs: the immutable artifact and the reader spec.** Also provide the non-evidentiary control metadata that bounds the pass: current change blast radius, named failure axes, and terminal condition. Give no design rationale, project background, or "just confirm X is fine"—those convert an independent reviewer into a rubber stamp. The reader spec and control metadata say who executes what and where to stop; they do not tell the reviewer that the implementation is correct. **For a SKILL.md the reader is another agent executing it**, and its failure mode is "I don't know which tool to call," not "I don't know this word"—ask which instructions it could not act on. Freeze all five fields before dispatch and never use post-hoc context to explain findings away.
   - **It is ground truth for comprehensibility and for completeness-against-a-corpus; it has no authority over taste.** Apply those two directly. Treat "this might be a bug / I'd suggest Y" as a hypothesis and reproduce it yourself first. Never delegate AI-slop or aesthetic judgment — same-model blind spot.
   - **Enumerate failure *axes*, not content areas — that also decides how many reviewers you run.** The axis is *the question you ask*; the area is *the material you read*. Three reviewers covering scenarios, arithmetic, and the diff but all asking "is this coherent?" is one reviewer billed three times. **One is the default and frequently sufficient**; add one only for an additional axis. The axis self-review is worst at is **fidelity** — "is this still faithful to commitments already made?" — because the author is the one who moved the commitment, and coherence and fidelity are orthogonal: an artifact can be flawlessly self-consistent while being completely unfaithful to what was decided.
   - **Freeze the review boundary before dispatch, and stop when that boundary is satisfied.** Record the immutable artifact/ref, reader spec, current change's blast radius, named failure axes, and terminal condition. A finding blocks this release when the current change caused it, widened it, newly advertised the affected behavior, or made an old contradiction reachable through the edited path. A pre-existing defect that is unchanged and was not newly promised is a separate backlog hypothesis, not automatic authorization to redesign the skill. After substantive fixes, a new reviewer rechecks the failed axes plus regression; it does not reopen an unbounded whole-skill audit. Full decision procedure and examples: [references/independent-review-protocol.md](references/independent-review-protocol.md).
   - **Leave an artifact, or this is just a warning.** Discipline #6 says a check yielding an opinion loses to one yielding an artifact — so this one produces a file too, or it loses to completion-drive exactly when it matters. Write `independent-review.md` under `skill-reviews/<skill-name>/` in your private, git-tracked knowledge repo: the **reviewer prompt verbatim** (so a later reader can see whether it was leading), the **findings with a disposition and reason each** (which is what separates legitimate filtering from discarding what hurts), and **what could not be checked**. If you don't know which repo is your private knowledge repo (or don't have one), say so and ask the user — do not guess a location that lands in either forbidden zone. Two forbidden locations: **NOT in `<skill-name>-workspace/`** (gitignored scratch dirs that get wiped — this file is cross-session review evidence and must survive them) and **NOT in any repo that is or may become public or distributed** — which normally rules out the reviewed skill's own repo (review content inherently quotes private paths, real names, and project details). Re-review with a *new* agent after a substantive edit — a rule, contract, or number changed, not a typo. **From Step 5 onward this file is the evidence the pass happened; its absence means it did not.** **Writing the file is not the same as it existing for the next session — `git add` + `git commit` it in that private repo in the same turn.** An uncommitted file sitting in a git working directory carries none of the "git-tracked" guarantee this rule exists for: it can be lost, overwritten, or simply never picked up by whatever process later checks "was this reviewed?" (real case: the file was written correctly, on the correct path, with real findings — and still failed a later automated check, because it had never been committed; the fix was one `git commit`, not a relocation).
   - Discipline #4's regression gate is mechanical and complementary: it proves you did not *delete* behavior. It says nothing about whether what you wrote can actually be followed.

6. **Design the checks you write so they cannot self-certify green.** Skills are largely made of checks — gates, checklists, "before you ship" steps — and a check that the executing context can pass *while violating the very rule it encodes* is worse than no check, because it manufactures confidence. The rules below are borrowed from fields that solved this before software:
   - **The verification must cover every clause of its rule.** If the rule says "A + B + C," the evidence must demand proof of A, *and* B, *and* C separately. One confirm line bolted onto a three-clause rule gets satisfied by whichever clause the author already did; the others are invisible. Real case: a report-authoring skill carried a delivery gate whose rule read "options as side-by-side chips + recommendation highlighted + **background written as complete, self-sufficient sentences a stranger could follow**" — but the evidence line under it asked only for "N decision items, all rendered as chips." The author ran the gate, wrote that evidence, self-certified green, and shipped a page whose labels were single characters with all the context deleted. The rule sat in the file the entire time; the check simply never measured that clause.
   - **A check that misfires on healthy input is worse than no check.** The failure above is a check that passes when it should fail; this is its mirror — a check that fails when it should pass. It is the more expensive one, because it teaches the operator to bypass reflexively (`--no-verify`, `SKIP=1`, `--force`), and once that reflex exists the gate is off for *every* input, including the ones it was built for. So when authoring a fail-closed check, **false positives outrank false negatives**: missing one real problem costs you that instance, while killing one healthy input costs you the entire gate.
     Watch for the tell: **the frustration of having hit the same trap repeatedly is itself the risk signal** — it is exactly the state in which an author ships a defense that was never calibrated against healthy input. Real case: after stepping on one formatting trap three times in a day, the author added a regex check to a linter; it killed **33 healthy inputs** on the project's own corpus and was reverted the same hour. Calibrate before you arm it — run any fail-closed check across real, known-good material and confirm zero false positives; prefer loosening it until it occasionally misses over letting it ever misfire. **And the corpus itself must contain real agent outputs, not only fixtures you constructed: a fresh agent's natural phrasing variation defeats fixed fixtures.** (2026-09-19: two constructed corpora passed a gate checker while a real replay's natural Chinese wording — 「在动作集」 for the template's 「入动作集」 — silently voided the checker's core semantic check; only the third real corpus caught it.) **After each fix round, convert that round's adversarial probes into the regression corpus** (attack probes → recall arm, controls → false-positive arm), copied into the bundle so `unittest discover` re-runs the whole bidirectional calibration — otherwise the next round re-finds the same holes and the corpus never learns. Convergence judging (shape of findings, not count) lives in [references/independent-review-protocol.md](references/independent-review-protocol.md).
   - **Make each item a falsifiable observation, not a self-assessment.** "Background is self-sufficient" cannot be failed by the person who wrote it; "cover the rest of the page, read one card alone, and state what it is deciding" can. Prefer checks that yield an artifact — a command's output, a quoted line, a screenshot — over checks that yield an opinion.
   - **The same suspicion applies to the checks you *run*, not just the ones you write.** The four rules above govern checks that ship inside a skill. But the greps, finds and one-off scripts you use to verify your **own** work are instruments too, and a wrong instrument reports a clean result just as confidently as a right one. In one 2026-07 session five separate verification commands lied in both directions: a `find` without `-L` reported an installed skill's files missing (they were behind a symlink); a `grep --exclude-dir=<name>` hid a second copy of the very thing being audited; an inverted shell condition raised a false alarm that a removal had not happened; a regex spanning newlines invented 55 "lost quotations"; and a search over two of five files reported two rules missing that were present in the third. **Every one of them was believed at first, and every one was caught only by re-running a differently-shaped check.**

     The fix is the oldest one in experimental practice: **run the instrument on a case whose answer you already know before trusting it on the case you don't.** Grepping for a string you expect to be absent? First grep for one you know is present, in the same command shape — if that returns 0 too, the command is broken, not the file. This costs one line and converts "I checked" into "I checked with an instrument I calibrated."

     **"Differently-shaped" means a different *predicate*, not a different command.** Two programs that decide the same question the same way are one instrument billed twice, and running both feels exactly like corroboration — it produces two numbers that agree, which is the shape of evidence. Real case (2026-09): a new check reported which bundled references were unreachable; a separate script written to confirm it returned the same count, and that agreement was written up as "calibrated, no false positives." Both asked *does the full path `references/<name>` appear in SKILL.md* — so both were blind to the same healthy form (a `### references/` section listing each file by bare name), and a correct skill was flagged. The known-answer sample above would have caught it in one line; a second implementation of the same rule never could. Before calling a cross-check independent, say out loud what question each side asks — if it is the same sentence, you have one instrument.

     Two specific shapes worth memorizing, because both appeared above and both fail *silently*: `find` does not follow symlinks without `-L` (and skill installs are frequently symlinks into a source repo), and `--exclude-dir` matches by basename everywhere in the tree, not just at the path you had in mind.

     **And there is a second half to this rule that only bites when the check SHIPS: calibrate against the *standard* implementation, not the one on your machine.** The instrument rule above keeps *your* conclusion honest; this keeps the *reader's* working. A tool-behavior claim written into a skill — a flag, a recursion mode, an option that "follows symlinks" — is executed on machines whose binaries you have never seen, and the divergence is silent on both ends: it works when you test it, and it quietly does nothing for them. Two mechanisms produce this, and both are invisible from inside a session: **the same command name resolves to a different program** (a shell alias or function shadowing the binary — note `\tool` only escapes an *alias*, so `command tool` or an absolute path is the only deterministic form), and **the same program behaves differently across implementations** (BSD vs GNU vs a drop-in replacement). Real case (2026-07): an author verified that `grep -R` follows symlinks, wrote it into a skill as the fix for a symlink trap, and shipped it to a 1200-star public repo — their `grep` was ugrep via a shell function; on macOS's own `/usr/bin/grep` the same `-R` matches nothing (it needs `-RS`), so the prescribed fix failed silently for most readers, inside the very section warning that validators fail silently.

     So: **before a tool-behavior assertion enters a shipped artifact, re-run it against the standard binary** (`/usr/bin/<tool>`), not the one your shell hands you. If it does not survive that, do not write the flag — **prefer the implementation-independent formulation**: resolve the path yourself (`readlink -f`) instead of betting on a recursion flag, do a substring test in a script instead of a line-oriented match, name the *behavior* you need instead of the option you happen to know. A prescription that only works in your environment is worse than no prescription, because the reader has no way to discover that it silently did nothing.

   - **Use what mature checklist practice already settled.** Decide whether a list is **READ-DO** (execute while reading — for low-frequency or unfamiliar procedures) or **DO-CONFIRM** (work from expertise, then stop at a defined **pause point** and confirm — for experienced operators under time pressure), and anchor it at a real pause point rather than "somewhere in the workflow." Keep it to the **killer items** — critical *and* commonly missed under pressure, roughly five to nine; everything beyond that dilutes compliance ([Gawande, *The Checklist Manifesto*](https://www.shortform.com/blog/types-of-checklists/)). And prefer Shingo's **control** over **warning** ([poka-yoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke)): a prose reminder depends on vigilance and loses to completion-drive, while a step that blocks progress or forces an artifact needs no vigilance at all. Where a skill can only warn, at least put the warning where the decision gets made — **a rule filed in a reference the executing context never opens is not, in practice, a rule.**

   - **A check can also self-certify by being *vacuous* — it examines zero of the thing it claims to examine, and passes.** The rules above catch a check that measures the wrong clause, misfires on healthy input, or rests on an uncalibrated instrument. Vacuous green looks like all of those passing: the run completes, exit 0, the assertion fires. The tell is a **count**: ask "how many items did this actually examine?" and have the case assert it, not just the exit code. Real case (2026-09-22): a dangling-reference gate's test case asserted `exit == 0` while its own fixture printed "0 citations examined" — the candidate set had been emptied, so nothing ever entered it. The number was in the output the whole time. So: **every gate test asserts the examined-item count against an expected value**, and a count of 0 on a fixture that demonstrably contains N items is a red test, not a green one.

     The only detector for vacuity is **mutation testing**: break the mechanism under test and confirm the affected case goes red. A case that survives every mutation has not been shown to test anything, however green it stays. Two constraints, learned by repairing the same case twice and still shipping it vacuous: ① **the mutation must remove the mechanism under test, not a convenient neighbour** — mutating a helper whose output a later line discards, or mutating a token that never enters the candidate set (too short, missing the delimiter the scanner keys on), leaves the case green for a reason unrelated to your rule; ② **a still-green mutated build means "my test never touched this", not "my test is robust"**. Convert each round's mutation into a permanent case alongside the false-positive arm above, or the next round re-finds the same hole.

On the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.

Of course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like "I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me", you can do that instead.

Do not run the description optimizer as a default step after building a skill. Write the description by the rules below and tune it later from real sessions where the skill missed or misfired.

Cool? Cool.

## First: coexistence check (official skill-creator plugin)

Before anything else, run one quick check (a single grep, no output needed on the common path): does `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/plugins/installed_plugins.json` contain `"skill-creator@claude-plugins-official"`?

- **Not present (the common case):** do nothing — do not install anything, do not mention this section to the user. Proceed with the engagement.
- **Present:** the official plugin's skill-creator and this edition now sit in the skill list with near-identical descriptions, so future sessions will route between them at random. Tell the user this in one or two sentences, then offer (never act without their consent):
  1. **Recommended** — run `scripts/setup_supersede_hook.sh install`. It copies a small self-checking SessionStart hook into their Claude config and registers it in `settings.json` (with a backup), so every future session deterministically routes skill work to this edition. Reversible with `scripts/setup_supersede_hook.sh uninstall`; the official plugin stays fully usable when asked for by name. On machines without the official plugin the installer refuses to install anything, so it can never leave a useless hook behind.
  2. Alternative — `claude plugin disable skill-creator@claude-plugins-official` (reversible with `enable`), which removes the ambiguity by taking the official entry out of the skill list entirely.

If the hook is already installed (`scripts/setup_supersede_hook.sh status` shows the SessionStart entry as present), skip all of this silently.

The same machinery is available for skills the user creates: when their skill deliberately overlaps an installed one, generate them a kit with `scripts/generate_supersede_kit.py` — see "Coexistence & Precedence" under Prior Art Research and [references/skill-precedence-and-coexistence.md](references/skill-precedence-and-coexistence.md).

## Communicating with the user

### Show the result, not just the work

For a Skill creation/update delivery, read
[delivery identity](references/delivery-identity.md). Generate the formal Skill
identity from verified source metadata, preserve its plugin version ownership,
and check the actual final reply against the task-bound candidate. Keep
installation, publication and business-result claims on their own evidence.

At delivery, ask whether the user needs to compare outcomes, inspect several artifacts or evidence items, or choose among unresolved options. If a visual report would make that result easier to understand or judge, load `report-with-html` and let it own the page structure, template, evidence presentation, and browser verification. Load `data-visualization-discipline` through that Skill when the report needs a chart. A single small edit or status update needs only a concise reply; the paired-eval viewer below already owns review of individual eval outputs and feedback, so do not duplicate it with another report.

When creating or improving another skill, apply the same decision to **that skill's normal user-facing result**. If visual reporting is a recurring part of its job, add a conditional handoff to `report-with-html` at the end of its runtime workflow and declare that dependency. If the reporting Skill is unavailable, say the requested visual deliverable is unavailable; do not silently invent a substitute template or claim a report was produced. Do not make every invocation generate HTML, and do not substitute a polished page for a verified result.

**Let a real report earn its template.** For a new Skill that will repeatedly generate customer-specific reports, first run it on a real authorized case and use `report-with-html` to produce and browser-verify the actual report. Show that report to the user. Once they can inspect its content, layout, and interactions, ask separately whether this report's reusable form should become that Skill's default template. Their approval of the report's facts is not approval of its future template. If they reject or have not answered, revise the report or leave it as a one-off; do not promote a template.

An approved template is **user-owned local data, not part of the Skill package**. Extract its reusable structure, visual treatment, and interactions to `~/.claude/skill-report-templates/<publisher-or-project>/<skill-name>/template.html`, with a sibling `manifest.json` recording the qualified Skill identity, approval date, and Skill version. Freeze the two filesystem-safe path segments in the new Skill's runtime instructions; do not derive a different directory from each installation path or current working directory. Remove the first customer's data, names, evidence, and conclusions. Do not write the approved template into the Skill's `assets/`, source repository, installation symlink, or plugin cache: an update to the Skill must not overwrite the user's approved form. Do not create this local directory before approval.

When authoring the new Skill, teach its runtime to check that stable local path. If an approved template exists and still fits the current report output contract, pass it as the approved starting form to `report-with-html`; otherwise use that Skill's ordinary report workflow and seek approval of the new form after the report is shown. If a Skill update changes the report contract, keep the old local template untouched and ask for renewed approval before replacing it. Future reports fill the approved form with each customer's verified data and still use `report-with-html` for generation and visual QA. A template on this machine does not ship with the Skill or automatically appear on another machine; do not freeze customer-specific claims or reuse an old report as current evidence.

The skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google "how to install npm". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.

So please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:

- "evaluation" and "benchmark" are borderline, but OK
- for "JSON" and "assertion" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them

It's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.

### Using AskUserQuestion (Critical — Read This)

**Use the AskUserQuestion tool aggressively at every decision point.** Do not ask open-ended text questions in conversation when structured choices exist. This is the single biggest UX improvement you can make — users juggle multiple windows and may not have looked at this conversation in 20 minutes.

**Every AskUserQuestion MUST follow this structure:**

1. **Re-ground**: State the skill name, current phase, and what just happened (1-2 sentences). The user may have context-switched away.
2. **Simplify**: Explain the decision in plain language. No function names or internal jargon. Say what it DOES, not what it's called.
3. **Recommend**: Lead with your recommendation and a one-line reason why. If options involve effort, show both scales: `(human: ~X min / Claude: ~Y min)`.
4. **Options**: Provide 2-4 concrete, lettered choices. Each option should be a clear action, not an abstract concept.

**Rules:**
- One decision per question — never batch unrelated choices
- Provide an escape hatch ("Other" is always implicit in AskUserQuestion)
- Accept the user's choice — nudge on tradeoffs but never refuse to proceed
- Skip the question if there's an obvious answer with no tradeoffs (just state what you'll do)
- **If a question times out with no answer (user away from keyboard), neither stall nor barrel through the taste/scope decisions.** Do the side-effect-free groundwork first — pre-edit snapshot, inventory, eval-case collection, read-only audits/health checks — and hold the judgment calls (restructure direction, what to delete, go/no-go) for when they're back. Then say plainly which you did and what is waiting on them.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Before the first write, follow [Edit Skills at Source Location](#critical-edit-skills-at-source-location).

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the live conversation first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

**Source inventory — always before drafting, with consent boundaries.** Inventory the live conversation and existing docs/skills that overlap (see Prior Art Research below). Earlier local session JSONL files are a separate private source: do not open or parse them unless the user explicitly asks to mine history or affirmatively approves that source after you explain what will be read. If approved, fold only relevant prior sessions in through the conversation-mining workflow's redacted extraction; never load raw transcripts into your own context. If not approved, continue from the live conversation and existing project sources without treating the missing history as a blocker.

When mining a conversation (or session transcripts), inventory **both asset classes — they land in different places**. *Knowledge* — endpoints, parameters, pitfalls, decision rules — becomes SKILL.md guidance or `references/`. *Code the session had to write* — helper scripts, injected snippets, renderers, one-off templates — is a `scripts/` candidate: first check whether an existing/upstream tool already owns that execution. Parameterize and bundle only the still-needed local helper or adapter; do not preserve a temporary reimplementation merely because this session wrote it. A prior distillation captured polished prose but omitted the reusable helpers; the general lesson is to keep both knowledge→references and code→scripts channels in frame.

When the source material is *past* session transcripts (the JSONL files under the Claude Code projects directory) rather than the live conversation, enter the conversation-mining workflow. Do not open raw transcripts in the main context or hand raw paths/content to subagents. Its deterministic manifest → discover → redact → chunk sequence must finish before any agent sees content; only redacted chunks may enter the minimum role/shard plan, with the exact unit count and concurrency cap declared under the budget gate.

**First, resolve which DIRECTION this is — before the questions below.** The request may be one of several *opposite* things: build a NEW skill / edit an EXISTING skill / optimize skill-creator itself / or it's not-a-skill-at-all (a one-off task). Guessing wrong wastes the whole session — the research you'd do for "new skill" is the wrong research for "optimize the meta-tool." When the phrasing is ambiguous (e.g. "make me a skill" while pointing at skill-creator's own path), one AskUserQuestion here costs 30 seconds. The wrapper-skill fork below is one special case of this; the direction check is general.

`Use skill-creator to optimize <existing-skill>` means the normal existing-skill update path. It does **not** authorize conversation-history mining, a broad rewrite, Tier 3 classification, or multi-agent evaluation. Inspect the actual proposed deltas first; escalate only for a failure surface those deltas really introduce.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art, taste-calibrated reports) often can't use assertions — but "no assertions" is not "no verification". Their verification paths, in order of cost:
   - **Historical-task replay**: re-run one real prompt the skill has served before, old vs new skill, and compare outputs against the specific rules that changed ("does the new output actually follow the tokens / title grammar this update introduced?"). Cheap, catches "the rule was written but nothing reads it".
   - **Production-as-eval**: acknowledge that the real test is the user's next actual use — then make the loop explicit: every user correction afterward is an incident to fold back (the skill's own "迭代/活文档" section), every approval is corpus material. A taste skill that ships without this write-back habit doesn't improve; one that has it converges without ever running a formal eval. **And when the skill's output is something that keeps running — a guard, a monitor, a scheduled job, a hook — its own telemetry is eval data, and the highest-signal record in it is the first false alarm.** A user correction requires a user to notice and bother; a deployed mechanism reports on itself unprompted, often within a day, and a false positive is the sharpest form of that report because it proves a rule you wrote is wrong in a way no amount of re-reading would have shown. Treat the first one as a scheduled eval result rather than an annoyance: check it before assuming the mechanism misbehaved, because the more likely finding is that the *instruction* was too absolute. (Real instance: a skill prescribed a fail-loud check, the deployed check fired once overnight on a perfectly healthy condition, and the fix was to correct the over-absolute sentence in the skill — nobody complained; the telemetry did.)
   - **Render + human review** for visual outputs (the skill's own visual-QA gates), never a grep assertion pretending to measure aesthetics. **And the renderer you verify with must be the same engine the deliverable will be consumed in** — whatever previewer is conveniently installed is not a substitute. A thumbnailer whose layout engine differs from the target application will silently *hide* the exact defects you are looking for, and a green verification on the wrong engine is worse than no verification, because it buys false confidence. Real case (2026-07): a .docx was "visually verified" through macOS Quick Look thumbnails, which do not reproduce justified-text stretching; Word showed the document's info blocks blown apart the moment the user opened it. The fix was to install the Word-compatible engine (LibreOffice), convert to PDF, rasterize per page, and read every page. Match the engine, or the verification is theater. **This generalizes past renderers to every verification tool** — parser, linter, validator: it must share an implementation with production, or its green is meaningless. Second case, same shape: an author tried to catch a markup pattern that corrupts the final document by checking at the source stage with a *different* markdown implementation than the production toolchain used — it parsed all three known-bad inputs as perfectly fine, so any pre-check built on it would have silently passed everything. The honest conclusion was that this particular defect is only detectable after the production tool has run, and the check belongs there. **When no available tool shares the production implementation, say the check cannot be done at that stage — do not build the one that can only produce false green.**
   Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.

After extracting answers from conversation history (or asking questions 1-3), use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm the skill type and testing strategy:

```
Creating skill "[name]" — here's what I understand so far:
- Purpose: [1-sentence summary]
- Triggers on: [key phrases]
- Output: [format]

RECOMMENDATION: [Objective/Subjective/Hybrid] skill → [suggested testing approach]

Options:
A) Objective output (files, code, data) — set up automated test cases (Recommended if output is verifiable)
B) Subjective output (writing, design) — qualitative human review only
C) Hybrid — automated checks for structure, human review for quality
D) Skip testing for now — just build the skill and iterate by feel
```

This upfront classification drives the entire evaluation strategy downstream. Get it right here to avoid wasted effort later.

### The extend-vs-create check — runs BEFORE any specialized branch

Each of the three specialized workflows below ends with "**do not** continue reading the sections below", and *Prior Art Research* happens to sit after them. **That ordering is layout, not execution order.** The extend-vs-create judgment applies to every branch, and skipping it is exactly how a session ships a skill that duplicates one already installed.

So before routing into wrapper-skill / conversation-mining / artifact-corpus, answer one question: **does a skill already exist that this capability belongs to?**

**Discover the roots, don't recall them.** A hand-maintained list of install locations is exactly the artifact that goes stale, and the root you forget is the one that bites.

**Search for the file, not for a directory named `skills`.** Skill directories are named after the *skill* (`skill-creator/`, `<suite>/<skill>/`), so a source repo, a marketplace clone and a plugin cache contain no directory called `skills` at all — searching for that name silently skips them while appearing to work. Every skill has a `SKILL.md`; that is the layout-agnostic handle.

```bash
# 1) discover
find ~ -type f -name SKILL.md -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' > /tmp/all-skills.txt

# 2) VERIFY COVERAGE BEFORE TRUSTING IT — `2>/dev/null` and permission denials hide gaps
#    silently, which is exactly how a sweep reports "nothing found" from a root it never
#    entered. A 0 on any line you expect means the search did not go there:
for r in '/.claude/skills/' '/plugins/marketplaces/' '/plugins/cache/' '/.claude-profiles/'; do
  printf '%6s  %s\n' "$(grep -c "$r" /tmp/all-skills.txt)" "$r"
done
# ...and grep for your own skill source repos by path; they must appear too.

# 3) filter by capability VOCABULARY, not by skill name — in every language the target
#    skill might be written in (a skill whose body is Chinese will not match English terms):
xargs grep -li -e '<domain-term>' -e '<域内术语>' < /tmp/all-skills.txt
```

Expect step 3 to take a few seconds and to still return more than you want; narrow with terms specific to the capability rather than generic ones (`chart` matches everything, `stacked bar` does not).

The roots this reaches — and that a from-memory list usually misses: the skill source repos (a `claude-code-skills` checkout and any `-pro` sibling), `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` and `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` (marketplace-installed suites — nothing in the source repos hints they are there), `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, per-profile config homes (`~/.claude-profiles/<name>/`), and — the one with no signposts at all — **every project's own `.claude/skills/`**. Step 2 is what makes that a claim you verified rather than one you inherited.

**Per-project skills are structurally invisible.** They live inside an unrelated project's working tree, so they appear in no marketplace, no global skill list, and no source-repo listing; nothing you would normally open while planning a new skill mentions them. Real case (2026-07): a session built a global skill for a domain, swept the source repos, the global dirs and the other-agent dirs, found nothing, and shipped. A later conversation-history search turned up a mature project-level skill for that exact domain, a month old, sitting in one project's `.claude/skills/` — carrying eight rules the new skill lacked, including one the user had personally dictated. Every root had been checked except the per-project one, and the sweep reported "no prior art" with complete confidence.

**What to do when the overlap *is* a project-level skill in an unrelated project** — the case that war story lands you in, and the one the three bullets below do not cover: you cannot add a sibling to a suite it has none of, and "extend it" would mean editing an unrelated project's working tree. The move that worked: **harvest its rules into the skill you are building, then retire the project-local one with the owner's consent** — it was written against real work, so treat it as the more mature source and reconcile *toward* it. Retiring someone's working skill is the owner's decision, not a side effect of your build.

Four things that sentence leaves out, each of which will stop you:

- **"Reconcile toward it" is a rebuttable presumption, not a rule.** Two standard exits: the project skill may be *stale* (rules written months ago against a system that moved), and it may be *project-specific* (rules that only hold under that project's constraints — importing them wholesale makes your skill narrow, which this file elsewhere tells you not to do). Harvested rules are another author's memory, so **re-verify each one** the way discipline #1 requires of anything you write into a skill.
- **"Retire" needs a mechanism, and its first step is not the one you reach for.** In order:

  1. **`find` the skill's *bodies*, before grepping for its *references*.** A skill routinely has more than one copy in the same repo — `.claude/skills/<name>/` and `.agents/skills/<name>/` are both loaded, by different tools, from the same working tree. Grep answers "who mentions it"; only `find` answers "how many of it are there".
     ```bash
     find <project> -type d -name '<skill-name>' -not -path '*/.git/*'
     ```
     **Do not put the skill's own name in `--exclude-dir`** (it matches by basename, so it hides every same-named directory including the copy you have not found — see the instrument rule in discipline #6). Real case (2026-07): a retirement did exactly that, fixed all five references it found, and left a second full copy under `.agents/skills/` — git-tracked, no retirement marker, a stale snapshot missing the newest rule — which the other tool would still load as live.
  2. **Verify the new home is actually reachable from where the old one was**, *before* deleting anything — a marketplace skill you just pushed is not installed until the marketplace is updated and the plugin installed, and retiring first leaves a window with neither:
     ```bash
     claude plugin marketplace update <marketplace>   # your push is not their cache
     claude plugin install <skill>@<marketplace>
     find -L ~/.claude/plugins/cache -path '*<skill>*' -name '*.md'   # -L: installs are often symlinks
     ```
     The `-L` is not optional — plugin caches frequently symlink into a source repo, and a bare `find` reports the files missing (see the instrument rule in discipline #6).
  3. **Then** grep for references and repoint the live ones. Distinguish **live instructions** (a skill list, a cross-reference, a handoff doc telling the next agent what to use) from **historical records** (a decision log entry saying "on date X we shipped this") — rewriting the second destroys an audit trail to fix a problem it does not have.
  4. **Then** replace each body with a `superseded by <skill>` stub rather than a bare deletion, and make every copy's stub byte-identical. **Keep the YAML frontmatter** — a `SKILL.md` without it may fail to load rather than fail informatively — but rewrite the `description` so the stub announces its own retirement instead of advertising the old triggers; otherwise it keeps winning the routing it no longer serves. The body needs only: where the capability went, and one line on why it moved.
- **Identify the owner with the ownership test below** (it applies here too: a project-level skill has no `marketplace.json`, but the project's `git remote` still tells you whose it is). When the owner is the person you are talking to, "consent" is one `AskUserQuestion`. **When the owner is unreachable, harvest only — do not retire** (which leaves both skills live and competing for the trigger, same end state as a declined retirement — see Coexistence & Precedence below).
- **If the owner declines to retire it**, you now have two skills competing for the same trigger; that is the Coexistence & Precedence problem below, not a failure.

**Search by capability vocabulary, not by skill name.** That project skill would not have matched a name search for the new skill's title; it matched on the domain terms inside its body. Grep the candidate roots for the *concepts* the new skill will handle.

If something overlaps:

**Deciding which bullet applies — whose skill is it?** A filesystem hit does not carry ownership. Read the marketplace's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` `owner` field, or `git remote -v` in the containing repo; a hit under `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` can just as easily be your *own* marketplace installed back onto your machine. A project-level skill has no `marketplace.json`, but its project's `git remote` answers the same question.

Two cases the probes get wrong or cannot answer, so check for them before trusting the result: a **fork** shows your own remote while the content is someone else's — treat it as third-party, because their upstream improvements still stop reaching you. And when there is **no marketplace.json and no remote** (a local-only project, a skill hand-copied into a global skills dir), the probes are silent rather than negative: **ask the owner instead of guessing**.

- **The overlap is a third party's skill** (a marketplace suite, an official plugin): **do not re-implement its capability.** Put a *thin increment* in the existing owning router/workflow when one exists — verified pitfalls, invocation and necessary adaptation — and **reference the upstream skill by its installed identity**. A usage lesson does not by itself justify another standalone skill. Cloning someone else's engine into your bundle is the expensive mistake: their upgrades stop reaching you, and the two copies drift apart silently. **Then check the identifiers that cross the seam you just created** — routing to the official tool means handles now travel between two address spaces, and whatever your side emits, theirs has to be able to resolve. Fix that where the identifier is produced, not in a paragraph telling the reader to convert it: the party that suffers may never have loaded your skill. Case 23 in [references/skill-development-methodology.md](references/skill-development-methodology.md) is the worked example, including why the documentation-shaped fix shipped to a public repo and still failed.
- **The overlap is your own skill**: first decide whether the gap is a workflow within its existing router. Keep one entry when tasks share account/identity, authorization, lifecycle and user intent; put the workflow's guide, scripts and cases beneath that owner. A sibling skill is justified when it needs a distinct invocation, permission or install/update boundary. Shared vendor or vocabulary alone is not a reason to merge unrelated jobs. Retiring an existing entry still requires the user's authorization and verified replacement. **Exception:** for an unrelated project's working tree, use the project-level ownership procedure above.
- **Some related skill already points at the gap you're filling** (e.g. its description says "for X, use Y"): after you build, close the loop — update that pointer, or you have left a dangling reference behind.

Before creating or restructuring a capability, state its **ownership decision** in the
existing plan: user entry → executable owner/upstream → home of our verified increment
→ dependency update path → user-visible completion evidence. Reuse the user's prior
choices; this is not a new approval gate or mandatory document. For a narrow edit
that leaves ownership unchanged, retain that mapping and proceed.

Only when no suitable owner exists, or a distinct invocation/lifecycle boundary is
justified, build a standalone skill. The evidence that permits an independent skill
must also prevent over-merging: an unrelated permission or lifecycle remains separate.

**Why this check earns its place at the top:** a real 2026-07 session spent a day getting a third-party docx engine to produce correct Chinese business documents, then reached for the wrapper-skill branch — which skips straight past Prior Art Research. The shape it was about to ship was a fresh skill re-carrying that engine's capability. The correct shape was a **three-layer reference chain**: third-party engine untouched → a thin increment skill holding the correct usage plus the verified generator script → the domain-workflow skill calling that increment. The user had to catch it twice before it landed, with the second correction being the sharper one: *"don't copy an extra one — write the correct usage on top of theirs, and reference their skill; that's what skill-as-code means."*

### Verification depth router (run before choosing any workflow)

Choose the **lowest tier that can falsify the changed behavior** before taking a generic or specialized workflow branch. Classify by the concrete delta and its failure surface, not line count or request vocabulary: one changed destructive command can outrank a long prose cleanup, while a request to "optimize" an existing skill may still be one bounded correction. Before selecting a tier, list the rules, contracts, scripts, permissions, and outputs you actually intend to change. If that list is not known yet, inspect first and keep the classification provisional; uncertainty about scope is not evidence for Tier 3.

| Tier | Use when | Required evidence | Do not add by default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Targeted** | This is an existing skill; no capability, trigger family, workflow branch, output contract, dependency, permission, or external-write behavior is added or materially changed; and the edit is exactly one of: (a) spelling/format-only with no behavior change, (b) a factual doc/config correction whose truth a direct authority decides, or (c) a bounded implementation repair that restores an explicit existing contract **and** whose repaired behavior a deterministic regression check covers. A clarification that can change agent behavior is not Tier 1. **Adding or materially rewriting `references/` content is not Tier 1 either, even when the SKILL.md diff is one line**: it changes the runtime loading surface — what an executing agent is told to open, and when — which is exactly the axis the deterministic gates cannot see (they check that references are *reachable*, never that their pointers are *acted on*). Start it at Tier 2, and escalate to Tier 3 when the change itself hits a Tier-3 trigger (it is a methodology expansion, or spans 3+ prompt classes). Tier 2's evidence for this shape: 1–2 with-skill replays whose acceptance criteria are **output-level** (did the new content shape the output — a literal "was the file opened" assertion is the literal-tool-path failure mode this skill's own guidance forbids); where the reference-load ledger hook is installed, its record of whether the file was opened is mechanical corroboration, not the criterion | For all three: run `quick_validate`, inspect the diff, and complete the existing-skill migration gate. Then use the matching evidence only: (a) exact readback/format check; (b) authoritative fact plus its narrow check; (c) explicit existing contract plus deterministic regression. Add discipline #5's one fresh reviewer only when its rule/contract/number threshold is crossed | Agent behavior replays, paired runs, baselines, graders, benchmark, viewer, eval files |
| **2 — Sampled behavior** | This is an existing skill; the change affects agent behavior but adds no capability, trigger family, output contract, script behavior, dependency, permission, or external write; and 1–2 named examples with explicit acceptance criteria can exercise the whole changed behavior. A bounded correction to one existing routing or evidence-selection rule stays here even when it changes the chosen path | Run only those 1–2 representative with-skill replays plus the narrow deterministic checks and the one fresh-context review required by discipline #5 | Baselines, paired fan-out, variance analysis, benchmark, viewer, or eval files by default. An explicit request for them goes through the separate evidence-budget gate and does not reclassify the change |
| **3 — Broad / high-risk** | Any of these is true: any new skill; any new or materially changed capability; broad cross-branch rewrite or methodology expansion; trigger/description optimization (running the optimizer loop, or adding or removing trigger families — shortening a description under the frontmatter rule with every old clause cited by the regression gate is not this); a new workflow branch or materially changed output contract, script capability, dependency, or permission; high-risk automation or external writes; or the changed behavior itself spans 3+ distinct prompt classes, repeated trials, or materially different approaches | Run deterministic gates first, then add only the evidence needed for the named failure axes. The full paired pipeline below is available only after the separate heavy-eval authorization gate passes; Tier 3 by itself does not start it, and the same gate can authorize extra evidence at another tier | Automatic paired fan-out, graders, benchmark, or viewer based only on the Tier 3 label |

For changes to persisted formats or partial state updates, permission-sensitive
checks, and commands whose output may exceed the tool response, load
[stateful-script-verification.md](references/stateful-script-verification.md).
Select its affected recipes as narrow deterministic evidence within the chosen tier.

For an operational Skill whose changed workflow needs installation, account
configuration, a live service or human cooperation, read
[first use and recovery](references/first-use-and-resume.md) before drafting that
workflow. Put automatic preparation and continuation in the ordinary entry,
reuse existing execution owners, and test the affected missing-state, valid-state
and interrupted-state paths against the original task. A written setup guide,
healthy process or loaded model alone does not establish first-use success.
Skip this route for reference-only Skills and self-sufficient file transforms.

#### Heavy-eval authorization gate — separate from tier classification

A tier describes **risk and uncertainty**; it does not authorize token spend or agent fan-out. Passing this gate changes the permitted evidence plan, not the tier. The generic paired baseline → grader → benchmark → viewer pipeline may run only when either:

- the user explicitly asks for A/B, baselines, benchmarking, repeated trials, a viewer, or multi-agent evaluation; or
- the executor can name at least three distinct prompt classes, competing plausible outcomes, and the decision that paired comparison would change, then obtains the user's explicit opt-in.

For an existing-skill optimization, default to zero eval agents: run deterministic checks first, then at most one or two with-skill replays if behavior remains uncertain. Discipline #5's one fresh-context reviewer is a release gate, not permission to create a reviewer team. A token/cost-sensitivity instruction blocks the heavy pipeline until the user explicitly reverses it.

Before spawning more than one research, mining, eval, or grading agent, separate **roles** from **execution units**:

- Each additional role or reviewer must own a distinct failure axis or output. Template availability never justifies another role.
- Necessary experimental arms and corpus shards may share an axis: with-skill and baseline arms need isolated contexts, and one mining role may need several bounded chunks. Before launch, state the exact total units, capped concurrency, and why combining them would contaminate the comparison or exceed the chunk budget. Run them serially by default; an explicit A/B/mining request authorizes only these necessary units, not extra roles.
- For fan-out proposed by the executor rather than explicitly requested, obtain opt-in to that count. If the interactive question tool is unavailable or the user does not answer, take the lighter evidence path; silence is not consent.

If a unit is neither a distinct role/output nor a necessary isolated arm/shard, do not spawn it.

Before preparing disk inputs for an authorized evaluation, declare the necessary
paths and one cumulative byte budget covering every arm, retry and evidence file,
with an explicit minimum free-space reserve and session owner. Use the executable
prepare → monitored run → finish contract in
[materialization-budget.md](references/materialization-budget.md). Read its measured
usage and terminal state; finish on success, failure and interruption, retaining
changed inputs and evidence. Missing limits stop preparation; sampling is not a hard
filesystem quota. The runner stops on observed overage; the agent must still
justify scope and verify the business outcome.

Escalate when a lower tier exposes unresolved behavior or contradictory evidence. A user's request to cancel or de-escalate evaluation immediately stops already-launched paired eval agents, baselines, graders, aggregation, and viewer work. Keep the risk classification if it remains informative, but report only the evidence actually run and the axes left unchecked; do not describe an unrun heavy suite as automatically "required" by the label. Do not cancel discipline #5's single fresh-context reviewer when its rule/contract/number threshold is crossed, or any safety gate needed to prevent destructive or external effects. The mechanical existing-skill migration audit, public-skill sanitization, and any domain-specific safety gate also remain independent of this router.

### Specialized Workflow: Wrapper Skills for Third-Party CLI Tools

Before committing to the generic skill-creation flow, check whether the session that led up to this point actually calls for the **wrapper skill** workflow instead. A wrapper skill is a companion that installs, configures, diagnoses, and repairs a pre-existing third-party CLI tool or skill package — code that someone else wrote and that the user has just spent a session getting to work on their machine.

Signals this applies (any two together are enough):

- The user has been installing a tool in the current conversation — downloading a `.zip`, running `npx` / `pip install` / `brew install`, dealing with an official installer.
- The session has produced real, concrete error messages and the user and Claude have worked out concrete fixes for them (edited files, added flags, bypassed aliases).
- The user says something like "wrap this up as a skill", "save this as a wrapper skill", "so other people don't have to go through this again", "把这次 session 做成一个 skill".
- The user explicitly mentions a third-party tool by name and wants other agents or other people to be able to use it without the learning curve they just paid.

Signals it does **not** apply (use the generic workflow above instead):

- The user wants a skill for something they're going to write from scratch.
- The session was smooth — no real friction to capture.
- The skill would wrap a service the user owns or controls (it's their code; edit the source instead of wrapping it).
- The "tool" is actually a methodology or workflow that doesn't involve installing any binary or package.

When the wrapper skill workflow applies, preserve the verification tier selected above. Creating a wrapper is creating a new skill, so it is Tier 3. **Do not** continue reading the generic authoring sections below; jump to [`workflows/wrapper-skill/workflow.md`](workflows/wrapper-skill/workflow.md) and follow that workflow end-to-end, including its verification protocol. It is a **retrospective distillation** workflow — its job is to mine the current conversation for the install flow, the bugs that were fixed, and the design decisions that were made, and to turn that mining output into a complete, self-contained wrapper skill that another user can install and benefit from without reliving the debugging session.

The wrapper skill workflow has its own architecture contract, code templates, and Tier 3 verification protocol — it replaces incompatible generic test-case mechanics because its output is a user's install state rather than a file that can be easily asserted on; it does not downgrade the work. Run the compatible generic steps selected by the evidence plan; generic paired-eval steps still require the heavy-eval authorization gate. Record which mechanics the specialized protocol replaced. The canonical reference implementation is the `ima-copilot` skill (at the root of the daymade/claude-code-skills repository — a bare relative link here already broke once when this skill moved into a suite, exactly as the cross-skill-reference rule below warns), a wrapper around the Tencent IMA skill distilled from a real session using this exact workflow.

### Specialized Workflow: Enrich a Skill from Conversation History

Before committing to the generic skill-creation flow, check whether the session is actually asking to **distill past conversations into a skill**. This is useful when the user has been debugging, designing, or exploring a topic over multiple Claude Code / Codex sessions and wants to turn the accumulated know-how into reusable `references/`.

**Explicit source intent is required.** A long live conversation, a recently completed debugging task, or `use skill-creator to optimize <skill>` is not consent to open local history and is not a reason to enter this workflow. Use the live conversation directly for a normal update. Enter conversation-mining only when the user explicitly asks to mine/distill earlier local conversations or identifies particular prior sessions as source material.

Signals this applies (all must hold):

- The user explicitly names local/past conversation history as an input, such as "mine my chat history", "enrich this skill from earlier sessions", or "把以前的对话沉淀到 skill 里".
- The source sessions and time/scope boundaries are known or confirmed.
- The intended output is reusable knowledge or code assets that are not already expressible from the live conversation and current skill bundle.

Signals it does **not** apply (use the generic workflow above instead):

- The user is creating a brand-new skill from a single prompt or idea.
- The user asks to optimize an existing skill without asking to read prior local history.
- The relevant corrections and evidence are already present in the live conversation.
- The user wants a wrapper around a third-party CLI tool they just installed (use the wrapper-skill workflow above).
- There is no local conversation history to mine and no transcript exports to process.
- The mined content is one-time personal notes that should live in `memory/` rather than a reusable reference file.
- The source material is a batch of finished artifacts the user has endorsed, rather than dialogue — use the artifact-corpus-distillation workflow below.

When the conversation-mining workflow applies, preserve the verification tier selected above. A new mined skill is Tier 3; enriching an existing skill stays at the selected tier only if it satisfies that tier's capability boundary. **Do not** continue reading the generic authoring sections below; jump to [`workflows/conversation-mining/workflow.md`](workflows/conversation-mining/workflow.md) and follow that workflow end-to-end, including its verification protocol. It is a **retrospective distillation** workflow: it discovers approved local histories, redacts and partitions them, runs only the mining pass(es) justified by the corpus, and promotes reviewed candidates after validation.

The conversation-mining workflow has its own architecture contract, agent prompts, templates, and verification protocol. That protocol implements the selected tier's specialized mechanics; run the compatible generic steps selected by the evidence plan, keep heavy generic steps behind their authorization gate, and record any substitution. It is the canonical way to turn explicitly approved conversation history into a skill's reusable knowledge base.

### Specialized Workflow: Distill User Preferences from an Approved-Artifact Corpus

Before committing to the generic flow, check whether the session is asking to **extract the user's real preferences from a batch of finished artifacts they have endorsed** — approved HTML report pages, generated documents, designs. This is the third distillation source, distinct from the two above: the material is **products, not conversations**, and the output is **taste made executable** (explicit principles, quantified parameters, vocabulary), not knowledge or install fixes.

Signals this applies (any one is enough):

- The user lists finished artifacts and says "这些都是我认可的样例" / "你来学到底什么是我想要的" / "extract my preferences from these approved examples".
- A taste-calibration skill (report generator, doc styler, deck builder) has an approved-sample corpus that keeps growing, and the user asks to make the skill *learn* from it rather than just index it.
- The user complains that a previous update "只加了示例" — only cataloged samples without changing skill behavior.

Signals it does **not** apply: the source material is dialogue/corrections rather than endorsed products (use conversation-mining); the samples are not personally approved by the user (approval is the admission gate — ask first).

When it applies, preserve the verification tier selected above, then jump to [`workflows/artifact-corpus-distillation/workflow.md`](workflows/artifact-corpus-distillation/workflow.md) and follow its verification protocol. A new corpus-derived skill is Tier 3; adding a materially new decision capability to an existing skill is also Tier 3. The specialized protocol implements the selected tier's corpus mechanics and does not downgrade them; run the compatible generic steps selected by the evidence plan, keep heavy generic steps behind their authorization gate, and record any substitution. Its core discipline, which also applies any time you add material to an existing skill: **cataloging ≠ distillation** — registering a sample in a corpus table changes nothing about the skill's next run; ask of every addition "*does this change a decision rule?*", and do not declare a distillation session done while the answer is no for everything written (methodology Case 15). The workflow's spine: script-extracted quantitative comparison across ALL artifacts (≥3-artifact threshold per pattern, checked exception lists per claimed constant) → layered induction with evidence anchors → write to the decision-rule layer (separating invariants from register-dependent variables) → independent completeness audit (standing discipline #5) → regression audit.

### Prior Art Research (Do Not Skip)

The user's private methodology — their domain rules, workflow decisions, competitive edge — is what makes a skill valuable. No public repo can provide that. But the user shouldn't waste time reinventing infrastructure (API clients, auth flows, rate limiting) when mature tools exist. Prior art research finds building blocks for the infrastructure layer so the skill can focus on encoding the user's unique methodology.

**Two axes, don't conflate them.** This section sources the *infrastructure* layer (tools / MCPs / libraries / existing skills to reuse). The *methodology* layer has two inputs of its own: the user's private edge (theirs alone, un-retrievable) **and the domain's established best-practices / science, which you retrieve into context by default per standing discipline #3.** Finding the right tool does not discharge the second — a viz skill that adopts a charting library but never absorbs Cleveland/Bertin is still capped at your pretraining. Do both.

**Search these channels in order.** Research inline by default. Use subagents only after the heavy-eval/agent-budget gate above establishes genuinely independent unknowns; the public-source channels are not a default fan-out package.

| Priority | Channel | What to search | How |
|----------|---------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | **Live conversation or explicitly approved history** | User's proven workflows, verified API patterns, corrections made during debugging | Use the current conversation directly. Search earlier local history only after the explicit-source gate above, then use the redacted conversation-mining path rather than ad-hoc grep |
| 2 | **Local documents & SOPs** | User's private methodology, runbooks, existing skills | Search project directory, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/references/` |
| 3 | **Installed plugins & MCPs** | Already-integrated tools | Check `~/.claude/plugins/`, parse `installed_plugins.json`; check `~/.claude.json` for configured MCP servers |
| 4 | **skills.sh** | Community skills | `WebFetch https://skills.sh/?q=<keyword>` |
| 5 | **Anthropic official plugins** | Official/partner plugins | `WebFetch https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins` and `external_plugins` directory |
| 6 | **MCP servers on GitHub** | Existing MCP servers for the same API | `WebSearch "<service-name> MCP server site:github.com"` |
| 7 | **Official API docs** | The target service's own documentation | `WebSearch "<service-name> API documentation"` or `WebFetch` the docs URL |
| 8 | **npm / PyPI** | SDK or CLI packages | `npm search <keyword>` or `curl https://pypi.org/pypi/<name>/json` |

Channels 1-3 surface the user's own proven patterns and existing integrations. Channels 4-8 find public infrastructure. The user's private SOP always takes precedence — public tools are building blocks, not replacements. In competitive domains (finance, trading, proprietary operations), the valuable methodology will never be public.

**Bias toward merge/extend over create-new, and sweep EVERY skill root — not just `~/.claude`.** When channels 1-3 turn up an existing skill that overlaps the requested domain, the usual right move is to extend or merge into it — **except when it lives in an unrelated project's working tree, where the direction reverses: harvest *from* it into the skill you are building rather than merging *into* it** (see the project-level case in the extend-vs-create check above) (one real "new skill" task became "make the existing extractor the extract-phase of the new archiver"), not to ship a parallel skill that competes for the same triggers — two overlapping skills fight over triggering and confuse users. When searching, **discover the install roots rather than recalling a list** — use the `SKILL.md` sweep and its coverage self-check from the extend-vs-create section above (searching for a directory named `skills` misses source repos, marketplace clones and plugin caches entirely, because their skill directories are named after the skill). Run the coverage check rather than trusting this sentence: **every project's own `.claude/skills/`** is the root a from-memory list reliably drops, because nothing outside that project references it. A skill the user already installed *anywhere* is the strongest prior art there is, and a project-local one is often the most mature: it was written against real work.

**If a public MCP server or skill is found, clone it and verify — don't trust the README:**

1. **Read the actual source code** — many projects have polished READMEs on hollow codebases
2. **Verify auth method** — does it match how the API actually authenticates? (X-Api-Key headers vs Bearer vs OAuth — many get this wrong)
3. **Check test coverage** — zero tests = prototype, not production-grade
4. **Check maintenance** — last commit date, open issue count, response to bug reports
5. **Check environment compatibility** — proxy/network assumptions, hardcoded DNS/IPs, region locks
6. **Check license** — MIT/Apache is fine; GPL/SSPL may conflict with proprietary use
7. **Check dependency weight** — huge dependency trees create conflict and security surface

**Decision matrix:**

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Mature MCP/SDK handles the infrastructure | **Adopt it, build on top** — install the MCP, then build the skill as a workflow layer encoding the user's methodology |
| Partial MCP or SDK exists | **Extend** — use for infrastructure, fill gaps in the skill |
| Official/public skill implements a required capability | **Verify and reuse it** — exercise the needed interface; keep local methodology, account constraints and acceptance as an increment under their owner. Public origin neither proves suitability nor makes it merely inspiration |
| Complementary skill provides a required sub-capability | **Choose by ownership/update boundary** — resolve an independently maintained dependency, or bundle an owned self-contained helper. See "Complementary Skills" below |
| Nothing public exists | **Build from scratch** — validate API access patterns work (auth, endpoints, proxy) before writing the full skill |
| Verified integration mismatch makes reuse unsuitable | **Choose the smallest justified adapter or replacement** — distinguish a fixable invocation/version gap from missing capability; explain maintenance and update consequences. Convenience alone does not override a user-selected upstream |
| User deliberately supersedes an installed skill (fork, hardened edition) | **Ship it with a supersede kit** — see "Coexistence & Precedence" below |

#### Coexistence & Precedence (deliberate overlap)

Merging into the existing skill is the default fix for overlap (above). But when the user *deliberately* ships a skill that overlaps an installed one — a fork of an official plugin, a hardened in-house edition — the two entries will sit in the skill list with similar descriptions and Claude will route between them at random. Resolve it, in escalating order: rename if the overlap is accidental; add a description tiebreaker ("supersedes X — when both appear, always use this one"); and for distributed forks, stamp a conditional supersede kit into the skill with `scripts/generate_supersede_kit.py` — a consent-based SessionStart routing hook that only ever installs on machines where the competitor is actually present, refuses to install elsewhere, and self-disables if either side disappears. Mechanics, decision table, SKILL.md sample wording, and sandbox verification: [references/skill-precedence-and-coexistence.md](references/skill-precedence-and-coexistence.md). This skill dogfoods the same kit against the official skill-creator plugin (see "First: coexistence check" at the top).

**The more common case: your new skill silently loses the trigger to the *installed population*, without any deliberate fork.** A skill's domain (image generation, PDF handling, dashboards) is often already crowded with several installed skills, and a fresh skill can lose auto-routing to all of them. So **verify triggering early — the build isn't done when the content is good.** After a draft exists, fire a few realistic queries through `claude -p` and check the new skill actually WINS; if it doesn't, **name the specific competitor** it lost to (different queries often lose to different skills). Then know two things: (1) **prose can't always win a crowded slot** — the resolution ladder is rename → description tiebreaker/SUPERSEDES → manual invocation → SessionStart routing hook (structural; modifies global config, so requires the user's explicit consent, same discipline as `--no-verify`); and (2) **the fix depends on who authored the competitor** — competitors that are *third-party* → accept manual invocation or a routing hook; competitors that are *your own* → merge/consolidate them into one, don't keep two of your skills fighting for the same trigger. (The full resolution ladder lives in [references/skill-precedence-and-coexistence.md](references/skill-precedence-and-coexistence.md) — that file is the SSOT; the summaries here and above are pointers, don't extend them independently.) Documenting the chosen path (e.g. an "Activation" note saying "invoke manually, competitors are third-party") stops the next session from re-litigating it. (methodology Case 13)

##### Complementary Skills: preserve the update owner

Resolve dependencies; do not assume they are installed, and do not treat copying
another maintained Skill as the default cure for a missing installation.

| Dependency | Integration |
|---|---|
| Official or independently maintained Skill/tool | Keep its source unmodified. Resolve the installed identity, verify required interface/version, install the exact dependency within existing authorization if missing, and read back a representative operation. Keep invocation fixes and business acceptance in our owning workflow; preserve the upstream update path |
| Our self-contained helper/template deliberately shipped with this capability | Bundle it when that is the chosen distribution contract. Keep one canonical source and a declared copy/update mechanism; test the shipped copy. Do not silently fork a separately maintained engine |
| Explicit standalone/offline distribution or approved fork | Bundle/pin only under that chosen boundary, with provenance/license, update responsibility and replacement tests. Keep this supported escape; a router is not mandatory for every skill |

For example, a profile installer may bundle its owned statusline helper so setup
works after one install. That does not imply copying an official cloud Skill into
a local operations router. The router must resolve/install its declared dependency
and verify the handoff instead of leaving the user to assemble prerequisites.

Stop dependency work once the authorized representative task works with the intended
identity and update owner. Missing dependencies are explicit failures, not permission
to guess APIs, use another account or reimplement a sender.

After research completes, present findings via **AskUserQuestion**:

```
Research complete for "[skill-name]". Here's what I found:

[1-2 sentence summary of what exists publicly]

RECOMMENDATION: [ADOPT / EXTEND / BUILD] because [one-line reason]

Options:
A) Adopt [tool/MCP X] for infrastructure, build methodology layer on top (Recommended)
B) Extend [partial tool Y] — use what works, fill gaps in the skill
C) Build from scratch — nothing found matches well enough
D) Show me the detailed findings before I decide
```

When in doubt, bias toward adopting mature infrastructure for the plumbing layer and building custom logic for the methodology layer — that's where the value lives.

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.

Check available MCPs when useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices). Research inline by default. Use a subagent only for a distinct unresolved question, and never turn tool availability into automatic parallel fan-out. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.

### Write the SKILL.md

When composing or reorganizing multiple workflows, apply the ownership decision
before filling directories. Keep the entry focused on routing, put cross-workflow
identity/authorization/completion in one reachable common contract, and keep each
workflow's local guide with its tools and cases. Keep vendor implementation outside
our bundle when its upstream owns it. Simple single-purpose skills can stay flat;
these are responsibility boundaries, not a mandatory folder template.

Before calling the structure ready, walk 1–2 representative changed tasks from the
entry to the selected guide, actual tool, working directory/dependency and final
business evidence. Reuse the selected tier's checks or fresh-context review; do not
launch a second audit merely for this step. A file tree, shorter SKILL.md or passing
links alone cannot prove correct routing. Stop when those tasks select the intended
owner, preserve prior exits and can reach verified outcomes; do not keep splitting
or merging for cosmetic uniformity.

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier
- **description**: the routing key — what the skill does and when to use it, nothing else. Every installed skill's description sits in every session's context, and they all share one listing budget: Claude Code cuts each entry at 1,536 characters and, when the listing overflows, drops the descriptions of the least-used skills entirely, leaving only their names. A long description does not just spend its own tokens; it pushes other skills out of view. 1024 characters is the spec's validity ceiling, not a target.

  Shape: `<what it does, one clause>. Use when <2–4 concrete situations or phrasings users actually type>. Not for <nearest sibling case> (use <sibling>).` Put the key use case first and write in third person. The first ~160 characters must stand on their own — what the skill does and its main trigger: Codex shows each description cut to a short prefix when many skills are installed (measured: ~165 characters with 260 skills), so later "Use when" items and "Not for" redirects reach only Claude Code.

  - **Length**: aim for 200–300 characters. Up to about 420 is fine when the skill must route between siblings or is itself a router; `quick_validate` warns above 420. When keeping every distinct job pushes past that, compress before accepting it: one phrasing per situation, a shorter what-it-does clause, no transport or implementation details ("over Tailscale", "via qmd"). Go over only if a distinct job would otherwise be lost, and say why in the PR.
  - **Hidden trigger moment**: if the moment to use the skill is not visible in the user's words (for example "before choosing any library"), open with one short `MUST be used before …` clause.
  - **Keep**: redirects to the nearest one or two sibling skills; a non-obvious secondary job, in one clause; one short "even when …" clause if it corrects a known misjudgment (e.g. "even when it looks like a one-line ffmpeg job"); two to four phrasings users really type, in their language (Chinese included).
  - **Move to the body**: operational rules ("CRITICAL: fetch media by path"), pitfalls, methodology, failure history, internal mechanisms, file or reference routing, version notes.
  - **Rewriting an existing description**: run the existing-skill regression gate ([Step 4](#step-4-edit-the-skill): `compare` against a Git-ref baseline, then `classify`, then `verify`). It lists every old description clause that no longer appears verbatim as a `description_clause` candidate. Split a clause that bundles several situations into single items, then give each item a home by its type:
    - **When to use** (a situation or phrasing that should make the skill fire, including timing such as "runs before committing", whose home is the hidden-trigger-moment clause): the home must be in the new description — the body is read only after the skill fires, so a body line cannot bring the trigger back. If the new description no longer covers it, decide: a variant or sub-case of a situation the new description still names, or another phrasing of one, is secondary and may be dropped; a distinct job the user would ask for on its own, which nothing left in the description leads to, goes back in. List every drop in the PR and changelog so a real miss can restore it. Record a drop as `removed_by_explicit_user_request`, citing the owner's request to rewrite under this rule as `user_approval`; without such a request, ask.
    - **Not for** (an exclusion or sibling redirect): the new description or the body. Never dropped.
    - **Operational rule, pitfall or routing**: the body, on a SKILL.md line about that same situation. A reference reached only through a row about a different situation is not a home. Never dropped.

    Same meaning in shorter or broader words is a home ("architecture" in a list of decision types covers "architecture decision"). A shared word with a different meaning is not ("inside a bug fix" does not preserve "Not for bug fixes"). Nor is a placeholder for words users literally type — people's names, product names, error strings: "its named contacts" does not preserve the names themselves.
  - **Drop**: exhaustive keyword lists, synonyms the model can infer, and "use it even when none of these words appear".
  - **Write sibling skills together**: descriptions in one family must agree on which skill owns what.
  - **Tune from real use, not up front**: when a real session shows the skill missing or misfiring, fix the description from that prompt. Do not run trigger-rate optimization on a fresh skill; you do not yet know how people will phrase it.
  - **User-started only**: if only the user should start the skill, set `disable-model-invocation: true`; its description then costs nothing in the listing.
- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)
- **the rest of the skill :)**

#### YAML Frontmatter Reference

All frontmatter fields except `description` are optional. Configure skill behavior using these fields between `---` markers:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Use when...
context: fork
agent: general-purpose
argument-hint: "[topic]"
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | No | Display name for the skill. If omitted, uses the directory name. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters). |
| `description` | Recommended | What the skill does and when to use it. Claude uses this to decide when to apply the skill. If omitted, uses the first paragraph of markdown content. |
| `context` | No | **Set to `fork` to run in a forked subagent context.** See "Inline vs Fork: Critical Decision" below — choosing wrong breaks your skill. |
| `agent` | No | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set. Options: `Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose`, or custom agents from `.claude/agents/`. Default: `general-purpose`. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | Set to `true` to prevent Claude from automatically loading this skill. Use for workflows you want to trigger manually with `/name`. Default: `false`. |
| `user-invocable` | No | Set to `false` to hide from the `/` menu. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: `true`. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Pre-approved tools list. **Recommendation: Do NOT set this field.** Omitting it gives the skill full tool access governed by the user's permission settings. Setting it restricts the skill's capabilities unnecessarily. |
| `model` | No | Model to use when this skill is active. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments. Example: `[issue-number]` or `[filename] [format]`. |
| `hooks` | No | Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. Example: `hooks: { pre-invoke: [{ command: "echo Starting" }] }`. See Claude Code Hooks documentation. |

**Special placeholder:** `$ARGUMENTS` in skill content is replaced with text the user provides after the skill name. For example, `/deep-research quantum computing` replaces `$ARGUMENTS` with `quantum computing`.

##### Inline vs Fork: Critical Decision

**This is the most important architectural decision when designing a skill.** Choosing wrong will silently break your skill's core capabilities.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Subagents cannot spawn other subagents.** A skill running with `context: fork` (as a subagent) CANNOT:
- Use the Task tool to spawn parallel exploration agents
- Use the Skill tool to invoke other skills
- Orchestrate any multi-agent workflow

**Decision guide:**

| Your skill needs to... | Use | Why |
|------------------------|-----|-----|
| Orchestrate parallel agents (Task tool) | **Inline** (no `context`) | Subagents can't spawn subagents |
| Call other skills (Skill tool) | **Inline** (no `context`) | Subagents can't invoke skills |
| Run Bash commands for external CLIs | **Inline** (no `context`) | Full tool access in main context |
| Perform a single focused task (research, analysis) | **Fork** (`context: fork`) | Isolated context, clean execution |
| Provide reference knowledge (coding conventions) | **Inline** (no `context`) | Guidelines enrich main conversation |
| Be callable BY other skills | **Fork** (`context: fork`) | Must be a subagent to be spawned |

**Fork skills that require a target MUST hard-stop when the caller gives none.** A
`context: fork` skill runs non-interactively — it **cannot ask the user** for a
missing input, and a `general-purpose` fork handed a skill body with no task will
**fabricate a plausible one** rather than stop (2026-09-20 incident: a no-arg
`competitors-analysis` fork invented an "A2A market" task 14s in and ran it for
1h23m). So if your fork skill declares a required target via `argument-hint` /
`$ARGUMENTS`, its body MUST open with a gate: *"if the caller did not provide this
target for THIS invocation, STOP and report the missing input — do not invent one,
do not infer one from disk state, do not fall through to a default mode."* The
gate must test **task provenance** (did the caller supply it), not argument-string
presence — a hardcoded default or a self-generated value satisfies the latter and
defeats the purpose. An "ask if missing" line is NOT a substitute: it is inert in
fork context.

**Example: Orchestrator skill (MUST be inline):**
```yaml
---
name: product-analysis
description: Multi-path parallel product analysis with cross-model synthesis
---

# Orchestrates parallel agents — inline is REQUIRED
1. Auto-detect available tools (which codex, etc.)
2. Launch 3-5 Task agents in parallel (Explore subagents)
3. Optionally invoke /competitors-analysis via Skill tool
4. Synthesize all results
```

**Example: Specialist skill (fork is correct):**
```yaml
---
name: deep-research
description: Research a topic thoroughly using multiple sources
context: fork
agent: Explore
---

Research $ARGUMENTS thoroughly:
1. Find relevant files using Glob and Grep
2. Read and analyze the code
3. Summarize findings with specific file references
```

**Example: Reference skill (inline, no task):**
```yaml
---
name: api-conventions
description: API design patterns for this codebase
---

When writing API endpoints:
- Use RESTful naming conventions
- Return consistent error formats
```

##### Composable Skill Design (Orthogonality)

Skills should be **orthogonal**: each skill handles one concern, and they combine through composition.

**Pattern: Orchestrator (inline) calls Specialist (fork)**
```
product-analysis (inline, orchestrator)
  ├─ Task agents for parallel exploration
  ├─ Skill('competitors-analysis', 'X') → fork subagent
  └─ Synthesizes all results

competitors-analysis (fork, specialist)
  └─ Single focused task: analyze one competitor codebase
```

**Rules for composability:**
1. The **caller** must be inline (no `context: fork`) to use Task/Skill tools
2. The **callee** should use `context: fork` to run in isolated subagent context
3. Each skill has a single responsibility — don't mix orchestration with execution
4. Share methodology via references (e.g., checklists, templates), not by duplicating code

##### Pipeline Handoff (Sequential Skill Chaining)

Beyond orchestrator/specialist composition, skills often form **sequential pipelines** where one skill's output is the next skill's input. Each skill should proactively suggest the logical next step after completing its work.

**Pattern: "Next Step" section at the end of SKILL.md**

```markdown
## Next Step: [Action Description]

After [this skill completes], suggest the natural next skill:

\```
[Summary of what was just accomplished].

Options:
A) [Next skill] — [one-line reason] (Recommended)
B) [Alternative skill] — [when this is better]
C) No thanks — [the current output is sufficient]
\```
```

**Real-world pipeline examples:**

```
youtube-downloader → asr-transcribe-to-text → transcript-fixer → meeting-minutes-taker → pdf-creator
deep-research → fact-checker → ppt-creator
doc-to-markdown → docs-cleaner
read-claude-code-history → continue-claude-code-work
```

**Rules for pipeline handoff:**
1. Every handoff is **opt-in** via AskUserQuestion — never auto-invoke the next skill without asking
2. Suggest only when the output naturally feeds into another skill — don't force connections
3. Include a "No thanks" option — the user may not need the full pipeline
4. The suggestion should explain **why** the next step helps (e.g., "ASR output typically contains recognition errors")
5. Keep it to 1-2 recommendations max — too many choices cause decision fatigue

**When to add a handoff:** Ask "does this skill's output commonly become another skill's input?" If yes, add a "Next Step" section. If the connection is rare or forced, don't add one.

**Anti-pattern:** Chaining skills that don't share a natural data flow. `pdf-creator → youtube-downloader` makes no sense. The pipeline must follow the user's actual workflow.

##### Auto-Detection Over Manual Flags

**Never add manual flags for capabilities that can be auto-detected.** Instead of requiring users to pass `--with-codex` or `--verbose`, detect capabilities at runtime:

```
# Good: Auto-detect and inform
Step 0: Check available tools
  - `which codex` → If found, inform user and enable cross-model analysis
  - `ls package.json` → If found, tailor prompts for Node.js project
  - `which docker` → If found, enable container-based execution

# Bad: Manual flags
argument-hint: [scope] [--with-codex] [--docker] [--verbose]
```

**Principle:** Capabilities auto-detect, user decides scope. A skill should discover what it CAN do and act accordingly, not require users to remember what tools are installed.

##### Invocation Control

| Frontmatter | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | Subagents can use |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| (default) | Yes | Yes | No (runs inline) |
| `context: fork` | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | No |
| `context: fork` + `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | Yes (when explicitly delegated) |

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

**Key patterns:**
- SKILL.md length should be driven by **information density**, not a line count target. A 600-line skill with no filler is better than a 200-line skill that omits critical knowledge and forces the model to guess. If the skill is getting long, ask: "Is every section earning its keep?" If yes, keep it. If sections are padded or explain things Claude already knows, trim those — not the useful content. When a skill genuinely covers many domains, split into references by domain rather than artificially cramming everything into a short main file.
- For an existing skill, progressive disclosure is a relocation strategy, not a deletion heuristic. The old runtime contract must remain reachable from SKILL.md in the packaged bundle; a trigger query, test assertion, changelog entry, or reviewer memory is not a runtime replacement.
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them. **`quick_validate` now reports the ones nothing links** (transitively — a reference cited from another reachable reference counts). This rule sat here as prose for a long time while nothing enforced it, and a skill shipped with an unreferenced reference after passing validation, a security scan, a verbatim run of every documented command, and CI: none of them ask whether a bundled file is reachable, and the file existing is exactly what makes the gap invisible. The finding is a note rather than a failure because some unreferenced files are deliberate — an author-facing template is not runtime guidance — and a gate that fails on those gets bypassed, which switches it off for the skills it was built for.
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:

#### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though.

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if "Input" and "Output" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

**Usability patterns worth building into a skill** - These four structural elements repeatedly turned a "works but confusing" skill into one users could actually drive — they were the concrete enhancements that made a heavily-used skill usable, so reach for them when a skill has modes, runs commands, or can be re-run:
- **Entry decision-tree**: if the skill has multiple modes, open with a tiny "user said X → use mode Y" map so the model routes correctly instead of guessing.
- **Expected-output block after each command**: show "what you should see" right after a command, so the model (and the user) can tell real success from silent failure.
- **Troubleshooting section**: enumerate the known failure modes and their fixes — the single most valuable section for a skill others will run on machines you can't see.
- **Step-0 idempotency guard**: if re-running could redo finished work, open with a cheap "is this already done?" check before doing anything expensive.

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

### Dates and Version References

**Keep factual dates — they tell readers when information was verified.** A skill about Suno v5.5 should say "Suno v5.5 (March 2026)" because without the date, future readers can't judge if the information is still current. Removing dates makes things worse, not better.

What to avoid is **conditional logic based on dates** ("if before August 2025, use the old API") — that becomes wrong the moment the date passes and nobody updates it.

Rules:
- **Release dates, "last verified" dates**: Keep them. They're reference points, not expiration dates
- **Pricing, rankings, legal status**: Include but mark as volatile ("~$0.035/gen as of last check") so readers know to re-verify
- **"Before X date do Y, after X date do Z"**: Don't write this. Pick the current method and optionally document the old one in a collapsed/deprecated section

#### Bundled Resources

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments
- **User-mutable data lives outside the bundle**: if a script accumulates user data (correction dictionaries, learned preferences, caches), store it under a stable home-relative directory (e.g. `~/.<skill-name>/`) with its own backup — never inside the skill directory. Skill installs are wiped and re-created on every update and suite migration; a home-relative store survives them untouched. This is how a dictionary-accumulating skill survived a full suite migration with zero user data loss

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both

##### Assets (`assets/`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents
- **Component shelf**: for artifact-generating skills, a `components` subfolder under `assets/` holds user-approved verbatim-embed fragments with frozen behavior contracts and a registry reference — see the Component-shelf check in Step 4

##### Privacy and Path References

**Decide the destination before applying any of this.** Everything below describes what
breaks when a skill ships to strangers. For a skill that lives in the author's own private
repo, the same "violations" are usually why it works — a real absolute path is what makes
the script runnable, a real account in a template is what saves the next run from re-filling
it. `quick_validate` auto-detects this (it asks `gh` whether the containing repo is private)
and downgrades portability/identifier findings to notes there; `--audience=public` forces the
strict pass when a private skill is being prepared for release.

**In a private skill, these findings are the owner's call, not yours.** Do not placeholder a
real path, rewrite a hardcoded credential, or "sanitize" an example without asking — you will
break a working tool to satisfy a rule written for a destination it was never going to. If
you think something should change, say what you found and let the owner decide. (The design
precedent is npm's `"private": true`: a declared destination that changes what the tooling
enforces, added because people kept publishing things by accident.)

**CRITICAL for skills intended for public distribution** — these must not contain
user-specific or company-specific information:

- **Forbidden**: Absolute paths to user directories (for example, user home directories)
- **Forbidden**: Personal usernames, company names, product names
- **Forbidden**: Hardcoded skill installation paths like `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Allowed**: Relative paths within the skill bundle (`scripts/example.py`, `references/guide.md`)
- **Allowed**: Standard placeholders (`<workspace>/project`, `<user>`, `<organization>`)
- **Carve-outs** (a validator implementing the Forbidden list literally would flag this very skill — misfiring on healthy input is worse than missing): the publisher's own name/brand when a supersede tiebreaker or attribution *requires* naming it; install paths like `~/.claude/skills/` when the passage is *about* those paths (teaching material, not a hardcoded dependency)

**Cross-skill references**: a bare relative path always means "inside this skill's own bundle" — validators and readers both treat it that way, so a bare path pointing at another skill's file fails validation and misleads readers. When pointing at another skill, name the owner in prose ("marketplace-dev's cache-and-source-patterns reference") and invoke skills by their namespaced name (`/suite-name:skill-name`, not a bare `/skill-name`). Bare cross-references break silently when skills move between suites — one suite migration left 21 broken cross-references across two cleanup passes because of this.

##### Versioning

**CRITICAL**: Skills should NOT contain version history or version numbers in SKILL.md:

- **Forbidden**: Version sections (`## Version`, `## Changelog`) in SKILL.md
- **Correct location**: Skill versions are tracked in marketplace.json under `plugins[].version`
- **Rationale**: Marketplace infrastructure manages versioning; SKILL.md should be timeless content

#### Reference File Naming

Filenames must be self-explanatory without reading contents.

**Pattern**: `<content-type>_<specificity>.md`

**Examples**:
- Bad: `commands.md`, `cli_usage.md`, `reference.md`
- Good: `script_parameters.md`, `api_endpoints.md`, `database_schema.md`

**Test**: Can someone understand the file's contents from the name alone?

**Starting a new reference**: copy `references/reference_template.md` — it carries the
frontmatter shape (`name`, and a `description` that says what the file covers *and when
to read it*, with trigger keywords) plus the section skeleton. Filling a template beats
inventing a layout each time, and the description field is what makes the file findable
rather than merely present.

Two carve-outs: hyphenated names are as good as underscored ones (the separator was never the point — self-explanation is); and files inside a named workflow directory (`workflows/<name>/workflow.md`, `patterns.md`) are directory-qualified — the directory supplies the specificity, and renaming them would break the parallel structure across workflows.

### Skill Creation Best Practice

Anthropic has written skill authoring best practices — retrieve it before you create or update any skills: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices.md

#### Development Methodology Reference

Also read [references/skill-development-methodology.md](references/skill-development-methodology.md) before starting — it covers the full development process with prior art research, counter review, and real failure case studies. The two references are complementary: the Anthropic doc covers principles, the methodology covers process.

### Full-eval test cases (separately authorized paired plan only)

Enter this section only when the heavy-eval authorization gate passes. Risk tier alone neither authorizes nor forbids this evidence; an explicit full-pipeline request does not reclassify the underlying change. Do not use it merely because a SKILL.md changed. A specialized workflow follows its substitution contract declared above.

After writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. **For skills that act on live systems (a running service, a logged-in client, production data), give each test prompt an explicit side-effect budget** — e.g. "probe read-only and conclude; do NOT execute the download / drive the UI." An eval that mutates a live environment while "just testing" is a real action, not a test. Present them via **AskUserQuestion**:

```
Skill draft is ready. Here are [N] test cases I'd like to run:

1. "[test prompt 1]" — tests [what aspect]
2. "[test prompt 2]" — tests [what aspect]
3. "[test prompt 3]" — tests [what aspect]

Each test runs the skill + a baseline (no skill) for comparison.
Estimated time: ~[X] minutes total.

RECOMMENDATION: Run all [N] test cases now.

Options:
A) Run all test cases (Recommended)
B) Run test cases, but let me modify them first
C) Add more test cases before running
D) Skip testing — the skill looks good enough to ship
```

Save test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.

```json
{
  "skill_name": "example-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "User's task prompt",
      "expected_output": "Description of expected result",
      "files": []
    }
  ]
}
```

See `references/eval_pipeline_schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).

## Full paired evaluation pipeline (separately authorized only)

Run this section only after the heavy-eval authorization gate passes. The risk tier remains whatever the changed behavior warrants. Execute the pipeline in decision-bearing stages and stop when the uncertainty or requested benchmark deliverable is resolved; do not pre-spawn downstream graders, aggregation, or viewer work. A user cancellation or de-escalation stops the heavy pipeline immediately. Do not use it without authorization or mechanically add generic mechanics that a specialized workflow explicitly replaces, and do not use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.

Put results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.

### Step 1: Run the approved with-skill / baseline pairs

Before making isolated input copies, follow
[materialization-budget.md](references/materialization-budget.md); export only the
declared paths from the frozen ref and run all arms under their shared budget.

For each approved test case, run one with-skill sample and its baseline under the same prompt and side-effect budget. These two arms intentionally share one failure axis but require isolated contexts; they are necessary experimental units, not extra reviewer roles. State the total arms and capped concurrency before launch. Run serially by default, and never exceed the authorized unit count.

**With-skill run:**

```
Execute this task:
- Skill path: <path-to-skill>
- Task: <eval prompt>
- Input files: <eval files if any, or "none">
- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/
- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., "the .docx file", "the final CSV">
```

**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):
- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.
- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version captured by the mandatory existing-skill regression gate before the first edit. Point the baseline subagent at that immutable snapshot and save to `old_skill/outputs/`. If no pre-edit snapshot exists, stop and reconstruct an authoritative baseline from Git before continuing; never use the already-edited tree as the old baseline. **Know what this comparison can resolve: it measures only this round's delta.** If the capability you most want to verify already exists in the pre-edit snapshot — a sibling session can commit exactly that fix just before you start — the with/old A/B has zero resolving power for it; pick an older ref as the baseline when that's the capability under test.

Write an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just "eval-0". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.

```json
{
  "eval_id": 0,
  "eval_name": "descriptive-name-here",
  "prompt": "The user's task prompt",
  "assertions": []
}
```

### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions

Don't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.

Good assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. **Write assertions against the intent, not a literal tool path** — "voice content survives into the answer", not "calls the sanctioned reader script". A run that reaches the intent through a different sanctioned route (e.g. reading an archive that already has the transcripts inlined) passes, and grading it as a literal-path failure manufactures a false negative you'll then "fix" in the wrong place. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment; their real verification paths (historical-task replay, production-as-eval with a write-back habit, render + human review) are listed under question 4 of "Capture Intent".

Update the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.

### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data

When each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:

```json
{
  "total_tokens": 84852,
  "duration_ms": 23332,
  "total_duration_seconds": 23.3
}
```

This is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.

### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer

Once all runs are done:

1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations. **But objective grep/script assertions cut both ways** (same-word-different-meaning false hits, wording-difference misses), so **benchmark pass-rate is a signal, not a verdict**: spot-check what each assertion actually matched, and watch for a baseline run that reveals a factual error in the skill itself (the "wait, the data IS in the API" moment). See methodology §5.3–5.6 + §6.4.

2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:
   ```bash
   uv run --frozen python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>
   ```
   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean +/- stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/eval_pipeline_schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.
Put each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.

3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the "Analyzing Benchmark Results" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.

4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:
   ```bash
   cd <skill-creator-path>
   nohup uv run --frozen python eval-viewer/generate_review.py \
     <workspace>/iteration-N \
     --skill-name "my-skill" \
     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   VIEWER_PID=$!
   ```
   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.

   **If the backgrounded viewer strands itself**: the process stays alive but nothing is listening — check with `lsof -a -p $VIEWER_PID -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` (empty) or curl the URL (fails); "no log output" is NOT a usable signal here because the launch line above redirects it to `/dev/null`. Kill it and fall back to `--static` rather than re-launching the same way.

   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks "Submit All Reviews". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.

Note: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.

5. **Tell the user** via **AskUserQuestion**:

```
Results are ready! I've opened the eval viewer in your browser.

- "Outputs" tab: click through each test case, leave feedback in the textbox
- "Benchmark" tab: quantitative comparison (pass rates, timing, tokens)

Take your time reviewing. When you're done, come back here.

RECOMMENDATION: Review the Outputs tab first — your qualitative feedback drives the next iteration more than the numbers do.

Options:
A) I've finished reviewing — read my feedback and improve the skill
B) I have questions about the results before giving feedback
C) Results look good enough — skip iteration, let's package the skill
D) Results need major rework — let's discuss before iterating
```

### What the user sees in the viewer

The "Outputs" tab shows one test case at a time:
- **Prompt**: the task that was given
- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible
- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output
- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail
- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type
- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox

The "Benchmark" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.

Navigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click "Submit All Reviews" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.

### Step 5: Read the feedback

When the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:

```json
{
  "reviews": [
    {"run_id": "eval-0-with_skill", "feedback": "the chart is missing axis labels", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-1-with_skill", "feedback": "", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"run_id": "eval-2-with_skill", "feedback": "perfect, love this", "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
```

Empty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.

Kill the viewer server when you're done with it:

```bash
kill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null
```

---

## Improving the skill

This is the heart of the loop. Improve from the evidence plan: authoritative facts and deterministic checks for Tier 1, 1–2 named behavior replays for Tier 2, or user-reviewed paired results when the separate heavy-eval gate authorizes them at any tier. Do not import paired-eval artifacts into the default Tier 1/2 path without that authorization.

### How to think about improvements

1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.

2. **Keep the prompt lean without deleting the contract.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight, but treat every deletion from an existing skill as a regression candidate until the old-vs-new audit classifies it. Move detailed but reusable behavior into a directly linked reference; do not leave it only in evals, a changelog, or your memory. Read the transcripts, not just final outputs—if the skill causes unproductive work, simplify the instruction and rerun the old capability cases rather than assuming fewer words means better behavior.

3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.

4. **Look for repeated work — in the eval transcripts AND in whatever conversation the skill was distilled from.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel. The same signal hides in a source conversation you distilled a skill from — code that session wrote even once is code every future run must rewrite; don't wait for eval runs to prove the repetition (skills whose eval loop is skipped never get that proof — the Scripts check in Step 4 of the creation process is the catch-point for those).

5. **Fold corrections back verbatim — same session, both levels.** For taste-calibrated skills the user's corrections ARE the eval set, but only if they land where a future run will read them. Two properties make the write-back converge: (a) **record the correction verbatim**, not paraphrased — exact words carry calibration signal a summary flattens ("绝对禁止这种东西" teaches a hard boundary; "user prefers fewer jumps" does not). Quote the words inside the rule they correct, with a date. (b) **Write back in the same session the correction happens, at both levels** — fix the artifact AND the skill's rule/reference/component; a correction that only fixes the artifact is invisible to every future run, and one deferred to "later" usually never lands. While writing it back, check whether the skill's own text *taught* the anti-pattern just banned — a correction often falsifies an existing instruction, and leaving the old advice standing guarantees recurrence (real case: a decision-page contract advised jump-style "goto anchors to the referenced figure"; the user banned exactly that, so the write-back had to amend the old sentence, not just add a new rule beside it). When the corrected thing is an interaction fragment, the write-back's final step is shelf promotion — see the Component-shelf check in Step 4.

This task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.

For Tier 1, apply an unambiguous evidence-backed correction directly; ask only when the evidence leaves a real choice. For Tier 2 or Tier 3, when user feedback exposes a meaningful design fork, present the improvement plan via **AskUserQuestion**:

```
I've read the feedback from [N] test cases. [X] had specific complaints, [Y] looked good.

Key issues:
- [Issue 1]: [plain-language summary]
- [Issue 2]: [plain-language summary]

RECOMMENDATION: [strategy] because [reason]

Options:
A) Iterative refinement — targeted fixes for the specific issues above (Recommended)
B) Structural redesign — the core approach needs rethinking (reclassifies Tier 1/2 work to Tier 3 before changing it)
C) Bundle a script — I noticed all test runs independently wrote similar code for [X] (reclassifies Tier 1/2 work to Tier 3 before adding the capability)
D) Expand test set first — add [N] more test cases to avoid overfitting (authorizes only the named extra evidence; risk tier still follows the changed behavior)
```

Selecting B or C may change the risk tier because it changes the implementation scope; selecting D does not. Each option authorizes only the named scope/evidence change. It does not authorize paired baselines, graders, benchmarks, a viewer, or additional roles unless those are named and the separate heavy-eval/fan-out gate passes.

### The iteration loop

After improving the skill:

1. Apply your improvements to the skill
2. Re-run the default tier evidence, plus any separately authorized evidence plan:
   - **Tier 1 default:** always re-run `quick_validate`, diff inspection, and the migration gate; then re-run only the matching subtype evidence — (a) exact readback/format check, (b) authoritative fact plus its narrow check, or (c) explicit existing contract plus deterministic regression. Do not create an iteration workspace unless a separate paired plan is authorized.
   - **Tier 2 default:** re-run only the same 1–2 named with-skill examples and narrow checks. Do not add a baseline, benchmark, viewer, or eval workspace unless a separate paired plan is authorized.
   - **Separately authorized generic paired run, at any tier:** rerun all approved test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. For a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill`; for an existing skill, the immutable original pre-edit version remains the preservation baseline for every iteration. An immediately previous iteration may supplement but never replace the original baseline.
3. Apply discipline #5 after a substantive rule, contract, or number change. For a separately authorized generic paired run, also launch the eval reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration; specialized workflows use their declared reviewer mechanics.
4. For a separately authorized generic paired run, wait for the user to review the new viewer results; otherwise decide from the default tier evidence unless a real user choice remains.
5. Read the new evidence or feedback, improve again if it falsifies the current version, and repeat at the same tier.

A user-requested cancellation or de-escalation remains in force for the rest of the task without changing its classification. Do not restart paired evals, baselines, graders, aggregation, or viewer work unless the user explicitly re-authorizes that evidence plan.

At the end of each **separately authorized generic paired** iteration, use **AskUserQuestion** as a checkpoint:

```
Iteration [N] complete. Results: [pass_rate]% assertions passing, [delta vs previous].

RECOMMENDATION: [Continue / Accept / Revert] because [one-line reason from the delta and remaining feedback].

Options:
A) Continue iterating — I see more room for improvement
B) Accept this version — it's good enough, let's move to packaging
C) Revert to previous iteration — this round made things worse
D) Run blind comparison — rigorously compare this version vs the previous one
```

Keep going until:
- The user says they're happy
- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)
- You're not making meaningful progress

---

## Advanced: Blind comparison

For situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks "is the new version actually better?"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.

This is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.

---

## Description Optimization

The description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. This loop is optional and not a default step: use it only when real sessions have shown the skill missing or misfiring, and build the eval set from those real prompts. Most description problems are fixed faster by editing the description by hand against the rules in the frontmatter section.

### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries

Create 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:

```json
[
  {"query": "the user prompt", "should_trigger": true},
  {"query": "another prompt", "should_trigger": false}
]
```

The queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).

Bad: `"Format this data"`, `"Extract text from PDF"`, `"Create a chart"`

Good: `"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think"`

For the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.

For the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.

The key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. "Write a fibonacci function" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.

### Step 2: Review with user

Present the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:

1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`
2. Replace the placeholders:
   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)
   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name
   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description
3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`
4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click "Export Eval Set"
5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)

This step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.

### Step 3: Run the optimization loop

Tell the user: "This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically."

Save the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:

```bash
cd <skill-creator-path>
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.run_loop \
  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \
  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \
  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \
  --max-iterations 5 \
  --verbose
```

Use the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.

While it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.

This handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.

**The loop self-aborts after iteration 1 if it detects total silence — you don't have to catch this by hand.** This is a code-level guard in `run_loop.py`, not just advice, and it distinguishes two causes of "iteration 1 came back with zero triggers on every should-trigger query":

- `exit_reason: "infra_error: ..."` — some query executions (should-trigger *or* not-should-trigger) raised exceptions (claude CLI not on PATH, timeout too short, network down) rather than cleanly returning "no trigger." Checked *first*, and deliberately fires on any nonzero error count, even a single flaky run out of dozens — a crash, however rare, is a more specific and actionable lead than "nothing fired," and the fix is environmental, not a description rewrite. The ratio in the message (e.g. `3/15`) is the read on severity: a large fraction means "stop, fix your environment"; a small fraction alongside a lot of clean 0-trigger runs means the environment probably has a minor flake worth checking *and* the description may genuinely be bad — check both. Check stderr for `Warning: query failed` lines either way.
- `exit_reason: "degenerate_harness: ..."` — checked only once the branch above rules out any execution errors, so this means every should-trigger *and* not-should-trigger query *actually ran* and *still* fired zero times (this is what "precision=100%" via a zero-denominator default actually means: not "perfect," but "nothing to divide"). The probe genuinely measures nothing — go diagnose competitor collision or a low-threshold domain (below) before touching the description at all.

Both checks run **only against iteration 1**, and **only when zero should-trigger queries fired** — a weak-but-nonzero iteration 1 (say 1/9 triggers) is a different, potentially-recoverable case and is deliberately left to iterate. `degenerate_harness` additionally requires not-should-trigger queries to have fired zero times too: if the description is merely polarity-inverted — missing every positive while accidentally matching several negatives — the probe is proven to work and `improve_description` has real gradient to act on, so the guard does not abort that case (only a genuinely dead probe does). And it requires zero execution errors on *either* side — a not-should-trigger query that raised an exception never actually ran, so its "0 triggers" can't be used as evidence the probe is dead; that's exactly what routes to `infra_error` instead. Either way it breaks immediately and skips `improve_description` entirely — the JSON and HTML still report `best_description`/`best_score` normally (nothing is suppressed), the exit reason is the signal that this particular run's numbers shouldn't be read as "this is a good description." (Real case, 2026-08: a full 5-iteration loop was launched with no pre-check; two complete iterations — each a full eval batch, minutes of wall time and dozens of `claude -p` subprocess calls — came back precision=100%/recall=0%/identical scores before anyone looked at the numbers, and every should-trigger *and* not-should-trigger query alike had fired zero times. The failure was diagnosable from iteration 1 alone; nothing in iterations 2+ added information.) The HTML report also renders a banner when either exit reason fires, so the browser view carries the same signal as the JSON/stderr, not just the two lower-visibility channels. (An earlier draft of this guard checked should-trigger triggers alone; two rounds of independent review — a fresh agent each round, the second checking the first round's fixes rather than re-covering old ground — constructed the polarity-inverted counter-example, the infra-vs-description ambiguity, the negative-side-errors gap, and a pre-existing `--holdout 0` report crash it surfaced along the way, all fixed before shipping.)

One caveat this guard can't cover: with `--runs-per-query 1` (the default is 3), a single should-trigger query with a genuinely-50%-ish trigger rate has a real chance of reading 0/1 by chance alone and tripping the guard on noise, not on a dead probe. The default `runs_per_query=3` is what makes "zero across every repeat of every positive query" a strong signal — if you override it down, this guard's false-positive risk goes up with it.

**Sanity-check the harness before you trust `best_description` — it can still return hollow output even when neither guard above fired.** Both checks only catch a *total* failure at iteration 1; a harness can also limp along with a persistently weak-but-nonzero signal across all 5 iterations without ever tripping either one. If every iteration reports **recall staying near 0% with identical or near-identical scores** past iteration 1, that's the same underlying problem the guards couldn't rule out — the "winning" description is usually just noise around iteration 1 unchanged. Before applying any `best_description`, run one obviously-should-trigger query yourself and confirm recall > 0. A recall-flat result across iterations means the harness is a hidden variable (commonly: the skill is losing the trigger to installed competitors — see Coexistence below) — do NOT apply its "best"; hand-author the description and verify it with real probes instead. (methodology Cases 12, 14) There is a second recall-0 root cause, distinct from competitor loss: the skill's task domain is *low-threshold* — the model does the job itself and never consults any skill — spelled out at the end of *How skill triggering works* below. Distinguish the two before reacting, because the fixes are opposite: a competitor is fixed by precedence/supersede, a low-threshold domain by abandoning the trigger probe entirely for production-as-eval.

**When you probe triggering yourself with `claude -p`, collect ALL skill calls in the run, not just the first — and remember tool-invocation is a proxy.** A `UserPromptSubmit`/`SessionStart` hook can inject an unrelated skill *before* the model chooses, so an "exit on the first Skill call" probe will misreport a false "didn't trigger." And "did it call the Skill tool" is not the same as "did the skill's content shape the output" (the model may read the skill without a visible Skill call) nor "is the output correct." A buggy probe is itself a hidden variable that keeps you optimizing against a wrong conclusion.

### How skill triggering works

Understanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like "read this PDF" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches — with one systematic exception (a low-threshold task domain) spelled out at the end of this section.

This means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like "read file X" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.

**But some skills fail this test for a reason no query rewrite can fix — the skill's whole *job* is a low-threshold task.** The paragraph above blames the query ("write a more substantial one"); this is the orthogonal case, where the skill's *domain* is what blocks triggering. If a skill exists to do something Claude will just do itself with a basic tool — convert audio to 16 kHz, downsample, extract one field, bulk-rename — then even a fully-specified query ("downsample this 48k stereo wav to 16k mono for whisper," path and all) won't trigger it: the model reaches straight for `Bash`/`ffmpeg` and never consults any skill. Query substance can't fix this, because the "I can just do this" judgment is about the *task*, not the wording.

Diagnose it before you burn an optimization loop: run one realistic query through `claude -p` and watch whether the model *ever* consults the skill across the whole run (per the ALL-skill-calls rule above), or goes straight to `Bash` and does the job itself. If it never consults, the trigger probe is structurally blind to this skill — recall reads ~0 no matter what you write, and that zero measures the model's do-it-myself reflex, not your description. Stop tuning against `claude -p` recall and verify the real way: production-as-eval (the user's next real, *interactive* use — headless `-p` is more action-biased than a real session and systematically under-reports triggering), plus output comparison where the skill produces a checkable artifact. (Observed on an audio-preprocessing skill: a headless run_eval sweep read recall 0 on *every* query — including an obvious "transcribe this recording" one — and a manual `claude -p` probe showed the model going straight to `Bash` to find and process the file, `Skill`=0 across the run. The zero measured headless action-bias, not the description; the real signal only shows up in interactive use.)

### Step 4: Apply the result

Take `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.

## CRITICAL: Edit Skills at Source Location

**NEVER edit installed skill copies first.** Treat all of these as installed/runtime copies unless the user explicitly says they are the source:
- `~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>`
- `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>`
- `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>`
- `~/.claude/plugins/cache/...`
- `~/.codex/plugins/cache/...`

Editing installed copies first causes changes to be:
- Lost when cache refreshes
- Not synced to source control
- Wasted effort requiring manual re-merge

**ALWAYS verify you're editing the source repository:**
```bash
# WRONG - cache location (read-only copy)
~/.claude/plugins/cache/daymade-skills/my-skill/1.0.0/my-skill/SKILL.md

# WRONG - personal installed copy unless explicitly used as source
~/.codex/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# RIGHT - source repository
<repo-root>/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

**Before any creation or edit**, run the source-owner check and say which path is source. This is separate from the private review archive and the runtime installation path:

```bash
uv run --project <skill-creator-dir> --frozen python <skill-creator-dir>/scripts/source_contract.py check-path <skill-dir> \
  --phase create --repo <source-repo> --scope marketplace
```

Stop on `invalid` or `unknown` before writing. An explicit `--repo` cannot override an existing source owner; for exported owner evidence, pass `--inventory <frozen-owner-inventory.json>`. New marketplace members must be registered before delivery; a permitted draft location is not a completed install.

For managed local sources, omit `--repo` only when the source-sync owner's inventory can establish the repository identity. An unavailable inventory is `unknown`, not permission to guess. Inventory source paths must be qualified absolute paths; missing, null or blank paths cannot borrow the caller's current directory. Linked worktrees are checked by their Git common directory. Project-local Skills use `--scope project`; reviewing or installing third-party packages does not make their cache an authored source.

At delivery, run the read-only check against the requested Skill name and declared source owner, not merely whatever happens to appear in a catalog:

```bash
uv run --project <skill-creator-dir> --frozen python <skill-creator-dir>/scripts/source_contract.py audit <skill-dir> \
  --repo <source-repo> --scope marketplace --install-path <installed-skill-entry>
```

This checks source containment, exact registration and source-backed installation identity. It never proves a current session loaded the Skill. Pass the original user outcome and separate source/install paths to `skill-reviewer`'s delivery contract; a runnable Skill, green tests and catalog visibility cannot substitute for ownership validation. Keep the contract private when it contains local paths. Missing runtime observations remain `unknown`.

If the available-skills list points at `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, or a plugin cache, do not assume that path is source. Locate the repository-backed source first, edit it, validate it, and only then sync the installed copy when the user needs immediate local runtime use.

**Verify the actual consumed file before claiming availability.** A marketplace's registered source path does not identify its installed cache or prove session loading. Resolve the installed entry, read the content at that resolved location, and run the applicable fresh-host check. For source-backed aliases and ordinary versioned plugin copies, follow the installation and verification procedures in [skill-governance](../skill-governance/references/skill-surface-governance.md). Source ownership, installation identity and current session evidence are separate checks.

### Concurrent sessions on the same skill repo

Power users run several Claude sessions at once, and skill repos are exactly where they collide: while you edit skill A, a sibling session may commit skill B (or even an earlier round of skill A) under you. One real session hit all three symptoms inside an hour — a `Write` rejected because the file changed after reading, and HEAD moving twice mid-task (methodology Case 16). The failure isn't the collision; it's a stale baseline or a clobbering write that silently mixes two sessions' work. Standing rules:

1. **Baseline from a git ref, not from the working tree**, whenever the repo is clean at task start: `git archive <HEAD-sha> <skill-dir> | tar -x -C <workspace>/skill-before` and pass `--baseline-origin git-ref:<sha>` to the audit. A tree snapshot taken minutes before someone else's commit is a baseline for a tree that no longer exists. **Extract into a fresh, non-existent directory.** Into an existing one, `tar -x` silently overwrites same-named files and leaves files the archive doesn't contain untouched — a mixed snapshot with zero signal at extract time, which `compare` later rejects as not matching the ref. Same trap, other command: `mv <dir> <existing-dir>` nests instead of replacing — and where `mv` is aliased to `mv -i`, a target-already-exists rename prints one prompt line and defaults to *not* happening, with exit 0 either way (verified by experiment).
2. **Re-read before write** when a write is rejected or any time has passed: diff what changed (`git log --oneline -3`, `git show <new-commit> --stat`), fold the other session's intent into your version — their edit usually has a reason — and only then write.
3. **Check HEAD *and which branch you are on* before committing.** `git log --oneline -1` catches a moved SHA: if it moved since your baseline, re-run the regression `compare` against the new ref before `verify` — the audit tool will reject a stale review anyway ("after skill changed"), so catching it yourself saves a round. But a sibling session can do something worse than advance HEAD: **it can switch the branch out from under you**, because a checkout is worktree-wide. Real sequence — `checkout -b feat/x`, edit for a while, and meanwhile another session ran `checkout main` + `pull`; the commit then landed on **main**, violating the repo's "never commit directly to local main" rule while the feature branch still pointed at the old base. So add `git branch --show-current` to the pre-commit check, not just the SHA. When it has already happened, `git reflog` is the authoritative reconstruction (it records each `checkout: moving from X to Y` with order), and the repair — **given a clean worktree** — is `git checkout -B <feature> <your-sha>` followed by `git branch -f main origin/main`: both are ref moves that never touch the working tree, so neither can destroy a parallel session's uncommitted work the way `reset --hard` would.
4. **Stage only your own paths** (`git add <skill-dir> <registry-file>`), never `git add .` — the sibling session's uncommitted work must not ride along. (Already the rule for packaging; doubly load-bearing under concurrency.)
5. **One version bump per session outcome**, not per editing round: consecutive same-session rounds on one skill collapse into a single bump — unless an intermediate state was already consumed (committed + pulled by the user or another session), which makes each consumed state its own version.
6. **Co-releasing another session's change in your PR is a contract, not a courtesy.** When two sessions' work lands in one release (their file riding in your commit): (a) ownership stays with the author — you stage their file, but the commit message names both changesets and who authored which; (b) read their full diff before staging — it accumulated across their rounds, not just their last message; (c) establish the 代改 (edit-on-their-behalf) fallback **explicitly before you need it**: who may edit their file, with what commit note, and the clobber rule (re-read the file state immediately before editing; never assume it is unchanged); (d) one release, not two — merge changelog entries additively (keep both authors' lines; never `--ours`/`--theirs`); (e) sanity-run their change yourself before it ships in your name — 2026-09-19: the staged co-shipped script had a release-blocking bug invisible in its author's environment (the documented invocation plus a color-forced environment broke it; caught only by running it in the staging session's own environment); (f) send the PR link back to them when it merges. **When the same file carries both sessions' uncommitted changes, never `git add` the whole file into one commit: branch from the clean ref, apply only your own sections to the clean version, and let the two PRs merge separately** (2026-09-19: a mixed working tree would have double-landed the other session's discipline #1 addition, colliding at merge; the fix was restore-from-ref plus selective re-application).

## Skill Creation Process (Step-by-Step)

When creating or updating a skill, follow these steps in order. Skip steps only when clearly not applicable.

### Step 0: Prerequisites Check

For `audit_skill_regression`, `release_readiness`, `source_contract` and
`materialize`, use the [fixed command entry](references/fixed-command-entry.md)
when calling from another working directory. Supply absolute artifact paths;
retain each owning tool's subcommands, flags and direct invocation.

Before starting any skill work, auto-detect all dependencies and proactively install anything missing. Discovering a missing tool mid-workflow (e.g., gitleaks at packaging time, PyYAML at validation) wastes time and breaks flow.

Run the quick check from [references/prerequisites.md](references/prerequisites.md), auto-install what you can, and present the user a summary checklist. Only proceed when all blocking dependencies are satisfied.

Key blockers: Python 3, uv, the locked skill-creator runtime (validation/packaging), and gitleaks (security scan). The claude CLI is blocking only when a separately authorized evidence plan actually runs agent evals. Run bundled Python tools from the skill-creator root with `uv run --frozen`, for example `uv run --frozen python -m scripts.quick_validate <skill-path>`. Bare `python3` depends on ambient site packages and can miss the locked dependencies.

**uv isolation contract:** Treat this directory as one normal uv project. Keep its committed `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, let uv materialize one project-local `.venv` from the shared global cache, and run bundled tools with `uv run --frozen`. Do not add per-call `--with` overlays for dependencies already locked here, do not set one global `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` across projects, and do not create a project-specific `UV_CACHE_DIR`. Never use `--no-cache`, `uv cache clean`, or `uv cache prune` as part of ordinary Skill execution; cache maintenance is a separately authorized disk operation.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

Analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Determining the appropriate level of freedom for Claude
3. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly
4. Deciding how a user will inspect the result: a concise reply, an existing domain artifact or viewer, or a conditional handoff to `report-with-html` when a visual report would clarify evidence, comparisons, or decisions. For recurring customer reports, plan a first real report and a **post-review template decision**; the approved form lives in user-local data outside the Skill package, never in its `assets/` or an update-owned cache.

**Match specificity to task risk:**
- **High freedom (text instructions)**: Multiple valid approaches exist
- **Medium freedom (pseudocode with parameters)**: Preferred patterns exist with acceptable variation
- **Low freedom (exact scripts)**: Operations are fragile, consistency critical

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

Skip this step if the skill already exists.

When creating a new skill from scratch, run [scripts/init_skill.py](scripts/init_skill.py)
from the locked skill-creator project:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.init_skill <skill-name> \
  --path <source-parent> --repo <source-repo> --scope marketplace
```

The script creates a template skill directory with proper frontmatter, resource directories, and example files.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

Before writing, retrieve Anthropic's best-practices doc (linked in "Skill Creation Best Practice" above) and the methodology reference — do this even when you feel you already know them: the doc updates, training-data versions go stale, and "I basically know it" is exactly the state in which editors skip it and miss the newest guidance.

When editing, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude.

**Existing-skill migration gate — required before the first edit:**

1. Capture the complete current bundle before editing. For a non-Git or dirty
   source, use the tool so the snapshot carries a verifiable provenance manifest:

   ```bash
   cd <skill-creator-path>
   uv run --frozen python -m scripts.audit_skill_regression snapshot \
     --source <path/to/skill-folder> \
     --output <workspace>/skill-before
   ```

   For a clean Git-tracked source, materialize the directory from the chosen ref:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p <workspace>/skill-before   # tar -C requires the target to already exist
   git -C <repo-containing-the-skill> archive <ref> <skill-dir-relative-to-repo-root> \
     | tar -x -C <workspace>/skill-before
   # lands at <workspace>/skill-before/<skill-dir>/SKILL.md — one level deeper than
   # the snapshot subcommand's output, because `git archive` preserves the path
   # prefix; --before in step 3 is <workspace>/skill-before/<skill-dir>, not
   # <workspace>/skill-before itself.
   ```

   Include SKILL.md, references, scripts, assets, workflows, and existing evals—not
   just the main prompt. Never copy the already-edited tree and label it "before".
   New snapshots record their inclusion policy so later verification uses the same
   source boundary. For local runtime authorization files, required configuration
   templates, legacy records, and verified ZIP archives, follow
   [source snapshot archives](references/source-snapshot-archives.md). Do not remove
   included files during handoff and continue using the original tree hash.
   **Use a directory nothing has extracted into before** — reusing one that already
   has content from an earlier run lets `tar -x` silently overwrite same-named files
   while leaving stale files the new archive doesn't contain untouched, producing a
   mixed snapshot with zero signal at extract time (`compare` only catches it later,
   indirectly, as a tree-hash mismatch). See "Concurrent sessions on the same skill
   repo" below for the fuller version of this trap, including the `mv`-based variant.
2. Inventory the old skill's actor/jobs, trigger contexts, runtime contracts,
   commands/flags, failure and recovery cases, page/domain variants, bundled
   resources, and eval coverage. Add preservation cases for important old edge
   behavior before a structural rewrite.
3. After editing, generate an old-vs-new review:

   ```bash
   cd <skill-creator-path>
   uv run --frozen python -m scripts.audit_skill_regression compare \
     --before <workspace>/skill-before \
     --after <path/to/skill-folder> \
     --output <workspace>/skill-regression-review.json \
     --baseline-origin pre-edit-snapshot
   ```

   If the old directory was reconstructed from Git, replace the final flag with
   `--baseline-origin git-ref:<ref>`. The tool resolves the ref to an immutable
   commit and verifies every included file and executable bit against that tree.

   **Renaming or moving the skill directory itself** (not just editing its
   contents) changes `--after`'s path, which both baseline modes use for
   identity — `compare` rejects that by default (on the assumption `--before`/
   `--after` were mismatched by accident) with `pre-edit snapshot source
   identity does not match the edited skill`. Add `--renamed-from <old-path>`
   (the path `--source` pointed at for `snapshot`, or the skill's old path
   relative to its repo root for `git-ref:`) to declare the rename explicitly;
   the identity check then verifies that path instead of `--after`, while the
   content/tree-hash check is untouched, so an actually-mismatched pairing
   still fails. **Pass `--renamed-from` as an absolute path.** Every path this
   command takes resolves relative to the current working directory when given
   as relative — not relative to `--after`, and not relative to each other —
   and `--renamed-from` typically names a directory that no longer exists (it
   was renamed away), so there's no existence check to catch a wrong
   resolution the way there is for `--before`/`--after`; it just fails deeper,
   confusingly. This bites skill-creator's own edits in particular: `cd
   <skill-creator-path>` above is skill-creator's own repo, which is usually a
   *different* repo from the skill being audited, so a relative
   `--renamed-from` silently resolves against the wrong one.

4. Review every candidate. Use exactly one disposition and record concrete
   evidence/reason: `preserved_or_moved`, `intentional_sanitization`,
   `intentional_boundary`, `removed_by_explicit_user_request`, `not_reusable`,
   or `true_gap_fixed`. Runtime capabilities cannot use `not_reusable`; moving a
   runtime capability outside this skill requires the owning destination, current
   boundary evidence, and traceable user approval. Explicit retirement must also
   quote/trace the user's approval. Preserved/sanitized/fixed claims must point to
   a real current file and line and include a short `contains` quote that the
   verifier can locate nearby. File-level candidates use the current file
   fingerprint plus a named semantic review explaining why behavior survived—the
   fingerprint alone proves file identity, not capability preservation.

   Don't hand-edit the review JSON or rewrite the same filler script each round —
   the `classify` subcommand does the mechanical part (locates the quote's line
   in the destination file, fills evidence/semantic_review, fail-fasts on a
   missing quote or a too-short reason). You still author every disposition and
   reason; it only types them in:

   ```bash
   uv run --frozen python -m scripts.audit_skill_regression classify \
     --review <workspace>/skill-regression-review.json \
     --after <path/to/skill-folder> \
     --map <workspace>/dispositions.json \
     --reviewer "<who-reviewed>"
   ```

   where `dispositions.json` maps candidate index (or id) to
   `{"destination": "<rel-file>", "needle": "<verbatim current quote>",
   "reason": "<why this counts as preserved/sanitized/…>",
   "disposition": "preserved_or_moved"}` (disposition defaults to
   `preserved_or_moved`; file-level candidates need only destination + a 40+
   char reason — the fingerprint is computed for you). **Copy the needle out of
   the destination file (Read/grep/sed), never type it from memory** — the lookup
   is exact-match and fail-fasts on a missing quote, and the two ways a hand-typed
   needle actually fails are full-width vs half-width punctuation (`：` vs `:`) and
   memory-paraphrased near-synonym characters (`也` vs `都`) — both escape
   self-review, and both get caught only by the tool rejecting your whole map (one
   map rejected twice in a row for exactly those two reasons).

   **The needle proves a line survives, not that a concept survives.** A
   `heading` candidate's needle can match any line in the new file while the
   *section it titled* — the heading plus its body content — has been scattered
   across other sections or compressed beyond recognition. Text-level survival
   is not semantic survival. For every `heading` candidate, after the needle
   passes, additionally verify: (a) the new file still has a section covering
   the same topic (find the corresponding heading or content block by meaning,
   not by string match), and (b) the new section's body is not trivially smaller
   than the old one — count the old section's non-blank lines and compare with
   the new section's. A section whose body shrank by more than half needs a
   `semantic_review` explaining what was deliberately compressed and why the
   compression is lossless. Skipping this check is how a restructure reports
   "162/162 preserved" while a named principle the user later asks about has
   silently lost its dedicated section (real case 2026-08-30: an "Outcome-first
   gate" section was scattered into a summary table row; every needle passed;
   the user had to ask "有没有丢失东西" to surface it).
5. Verify the completed review. Hashes make the review stale after any further
   edit, so regenerate and reclassify when the candidate changes. A passing
   verification writes `.skill-regression-reviewed`, a content-bound local status
   receipt. It helps detect later edits, but it is deliberately not standalone
   packaging authority; packaging re-verifies the completed review itself:

   ```bash
   uv run --frozen python -m scripts.audit_skill_regression verify \
     --before <workspace>/skill-before \
     --after <path/to/skill-folder> \
     --review <workspace>/skill-regression-review.json
   ```

What success looks like at each gate step (real output, so silent failure is recognizable):

   ```
   $ … compare …
   Regression audit: 8 candidate(s), 371 exact preservation(s)   # exit 1 = candidates to review
   $ … classify …
   Classified 8 candidate(s).                                    # exit 1 = some still unclassified
   $ … verify …
   Skill regression review passed.
   Regression attestation created: .skill-regression-reviewed    # exit 0 = gate cleared
   ```

`compare` returning 1 means review candidates exist, not that the tool failed;
2 means invocation/runtime failure. The tool proves exact movement and interface
preservation, but deliberately refuses to infer semantic equivalence from fuzzy
word overlap. A generic phrase such as “check permission denied” cannot silently
replace a precise signed-in-without-role contract. Also inspect candidates marked
`only_outside_runtime`: runtime behavior present only in evals, tests, or an
unreachable reference is absent from the normal invocation path.

**Validate immediately after every SKILL.md edit — don't wait for packaging (Step 7).** The failure this catches early is real: a frontmatter description written as an unquoted YAML scalar parses fine in Claude Code's lenient parser but breaks in strict parsers (codex reported `invalid YAML: mapping values are not allowed` on a skill that had been shipping for months), and a ` #` inside an unquoted description doesn't even error — it silently truncates everything after it, so the trigger keywords vanish while every scan stays green.

```bash
cd <skill-creator-path>
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.quick_validate <path/to/skill-folder>
```

**Write the description as a YAML block scalar** (`description: >-` followed by an indented paragraph) whenever it contains `: ` or ` #` or spans multiple sentences — block scalars tolerate both characters natively — the recommended convention for every new or edited description since the incident above.

**When updating an existing skill**: Scan every existing reference and bundled
resource for corresponding updates, then pass the migration gate above. Moving a
contract requires a direct runtime pointer from SKILL.md; an eval or changelog is
not a replacement.

The next three checks are **escalation probes, not unconditional scope expansion**. If acting on one would add or materially change a capability, workflow branch, output contract, script behavior, dependency, permission, or external write, stop and reclassify to Tier 3 before changing the skill. Tier 1 and Tier 2 may inspect these questions, but they do not acquire new deliverables from them.

**Scripts check**: Before calling the edit done, ask: *what code did the source conversation (or the eval transcripts) write — that every future invocation would otherwise rewrite?* When the selected tier already authorizes that capability work, bundle it into `scripts/` (parameterized, sanitized) and change the docs to point at it. Otherwise record the signal as a Tier 3 proposal and do not bundle it as a Tier 1/2 side effect. The division of labor: **scripts carry the execution, docs carry the understanding** — a skill whose method lives only in prose re-pays the full authoring cost on every run. This check exists here, in the edit step, precisely because paths that skip the eval loop (conversation distillation, direct edits) never reach the eval-transcript version of this check in "Improving the skill".

**Component-shelf check (the same question, asked of artifact-EMBEDDED fragments)**: the Scripts check covers code the *skill* executes; artifact-generating skills (report pages, decks, documents) also accumulate fragments their *outputs* embed — an image-overlay widget, a sticky nav, a chart config, a CSS block. If successive outputs each hand-write a similar fragment, that is the same repetition signal pointing at a different shelf. Before adding a `components` subfolder or registry reference, apply the escalation rule above; Tier 1/2 surface the proposal but do not create the component capability. When Tier 3 is authorized, what turns a snippet into a shelf component is the contract around it: (a) **verbatim-embed block** — BEGIN/END markers copied whole into the artifact, zero dependencies, so single-file artifacts stay self-contained; (b) **registry entry** stating the interaction contract (triggers, key bindings, close behavior, edge cases) and provenance — which delivered artifact it came from, when the user approved it; (c) **admission gate** — only fragments the user has actually used and approved enter (the approved-corpus discipline applied to interactions; unapproved-but-pretty stays out); (d) **behavior frozen, skin adjustable** — calibrated behavior and key bindings are the contract and must not drift between runs, while colors and sizing may follow the artifact's register; (e) **write-back loop** — a fragment invented for one artifact is promoted to the shelf in the same session its approval lands. The reason this matters beyond token savings: hand-rewritten fragments *drift* — each rewrite subtly changes key bindings, close behavior, counters — and for a user who reads these artifacts daily, interaction consistency IS the product experience. In the user's founding words for the first such shelf: 交互形式要沉淀下来、可复用、有复利，代表一致的交互喜好 (2026-07). Real instance (project fingerprints removed): a report-page skill's lightbox-gallery component (image overlay: ←/→ cycles the group, ESC closes, in-place zoom, n/N counter) with its interaction-components registry reference — extracted the same session the user corrected jump-style references, and verified with an automated click-through test before shipping. See methodology Case 17.

**Pipeline check**: Consider whether this skill's output naturally feeds into another skill, and whether an existing skill should chain *into* this one. Adding or materially changing a "Next Step" handoff or pipeline contract requires Tier 3 reclassification before the edit; Tier 1/2 may surface the proposal but must not add it in passing.

**Reference-and-self-application check (the defects that survive a careful author)**: a family of failure modes that all look like finished work from the inside, and none of which is caught by re-reading harder — each needs a *mechanical* action instead. (No count is written in that opener on purpose. "Three failure modes:" is a derived number that goes stale the moment anyone appends a bullet, and counting prose is the hardest drift to catch precisely because it *does not contain the thing that changed* — renumbering greps and diffs of the list itself both sail straight past it.) They are grouped here because they share one cause: **writing an assertion and verifying it are different modes, and a single pass cannot hold both.** While you are composing, "see rule 8" *is* the claim; you are not simultaneously opening rule 8.

Unlike the three escalation probes above, this one is **not** scoped by tier — it is scoped by what you wrote. A Tier 1 fix that added no pointer and no normative rule has nothing here to do, and you do not have to judge that yourself: the corollary's script answers it in seconds by reporting `NONE prose-reference-shaped`. Wrote a pointer or a rule, at any tier? Then the bullets apply.

- **Every pointer you write, open its target and copy one line out of it — before you write the pointer.** Not "I'm confident that rule lists all three markers": paste a fragment of it — into whatever you are already producing for this step (the review note, the commit message body, your reply), somewhere a second reader could later check it against the target. A fragment you only look at is the self-assessment this sentence opens by rejecting. A wrong cross-reference is invisible on re-read, because a wrong pointer looks exactly like a right one, and the author is the one person guaranteed to "remember" what the target says. Real case: an author wrote "see Cardinal rule 3" meaning a rule about not citing stale enumerations — but the referenced document's *own* rule 3 was about sample size, and the rule actually being quoted lived in a different file; a reader following that document's established self-reference convention lands on an unrelated topic. The same editing pass also shipped a pointer whose direction was inverted ("see below" for material above) and one naming a section heading that does not exist.
- **A bare "rule N" is ambiguous the moment a file has two numbered lists.** The check is per-pointer, not per-file: before writing "rule N", run `grep -n '^N\. ' <file>` and confirm exactly one hit falls in the section you mean; if several do, name the section too. (Do **not** turn this into a file-level alarm like "does this file contain more than one list starting at 1" — on any long document that is true almost always, so it fires on healthy input and gets ignored, which discipline #6 warns is worse than no check; run it on this file and see for yourself.) In the real case a bare "rule 1" had three candidate lists and a top-down search hit the wrong one first.
- **After writing any normative rule, check it against the lines beside it — and make the check produce an artifact, not a verdict.** Read your own hunk with `git diff <base-ref> -- <file>`, using the same `<base-ref>` as the corollary below. Reading it yourself is enough here — you are not pattern-matching it, so it needs no script — but it must carry that ref: a bare `git diff` shows unstaged work only and prints nothing the moment you `git add`, which is one of the five silent-empty modes this block's own corollary was built to escape. Split the new rule into its separate clauses, and write down, per clause, the line *in that same hunk* that satisfies it. (The `scripts/reference_net.sh` in the corollary below is a different job: it lists *prose cross-references* for you to resolve. It does not hand you the hunk, and it will not tell you whether a clause of your rule is satisfied.) **A clause with no line beside it is the finding.** The tempting short version — "does my new rule pass?" — cannot fail for the person who wrote it 30 seconds ago; that is precisely what discipline #6 means by preferring a falsifiable observation to a self-assessment, so this bullet owes the same artifact it demands. Its first victim is usually the paragraph beside it. Real case: a rule was added saying "always report both the raw and the filtered count — the difference *is* the contamination", and its own worked example, in the same commit, printed only the filtered numbers. A second statement in that same diff quoted two figures without saying whether they were collected under the qualifier the neighbouring new rule had just made mandatory. The scope is small and bounded: not "re-read the document", just "does the rule I wrote 30 seconds ago pass on the lines I wrote 30 seconds ago".
- **Give every new rule one line naming who executes it and whether they actually can.** A rule the existing tooling cannot satisfy is a rule that gets skipped by people who believe they complied — the worst kind, because it produces documented false confidence. Real case: a new rule said "check both log stores"; the project's own canonical one-command triage tool hardcodes one of them, so the standard workflow returns a clean result for exactly the failure the rule existed to catch. The rule was true and inert, and did not mention the gap. **The artifact that makes this falsifiable** (without it this bullet is the one self-assessment in a block that bans them): name the tool or command that would catch a violation, then **run it once against a case you already know it should catch**. If it comes back clean on a known-bad input, you have measured that the rule is inert — write that gap into the rule itself. "Whether they actually can" answered from memory is exactly the unverified assertion discipline #6 rejects. **When no tool can decide the rule** — true for most prose and taste rules, so do not treat this as an escape hatch — the artifact is the sentence naming that: *"nothing enforces this; it holds only while someone remembers it."* That is a worse position to be in than a passing check, and saying so out loud is the point; a rule whose enforcement is silent gets assumed rather than verified. Note this bullet's own honest limit: the choice of tool and of known-bad case is still a judgment call, so it moves the unverified step rather than removing it — it is cheaper than the alternative, not free.
- **Corollary — your fixes are themselves a defect source, so re-check the regions you touched, after the last edit.** In a two-round review of a single change, round 1 produced eight findings; round 2 produced eight more, **seven of which were cross-reference errors introduced by round 1's fixes**. Rewriting a sentence moves the anchors around it. This is also why "it was reviewed" is not a finish line for an artifact whose readers navigate by its pointers: the review is stale the moment you act on it. The re-check is mechanical, and it is a **script**, not a command to retype: `scripts/reference_net.sh <base-ref> <file>…` (in this skill's bundle). It lists the prose cross-references among the lines you added, so you can open each target and confirm it says what you claim. Read its header before first use — it explains why it takes a base ref rather than defaulting to `HEAD`, and what it deliberately does *not* do.

**Get `<base-ref>` before you start editing, not after.** Resolve it once to a literal SHA — `BASE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)` at the moment you begin — and reuse that same value for this and for the bullet above. If you ran the existing-skill migration gate, it is the ref you already baselined against. Passing `HEAD` *later* is the trap: after you commit, `HEAD` contains your own work, the script truthfully reports `IDENTICAL`, and that is indistinguishable from having nothing to check. If you did not capture it up front, recover it (`git log`, `git reflog`, or the baseline you gave the migration gate) rather than substituting `HEAD`; the script prints a note when your base ref is also your current HEAD, but do not rely on catching it there.

**Why a script here, when the rest of this block is prose.** The one-liner this replaces went through five rounds of patches — anchor the diff to the right base, see staged edits, survive committing, skip the diff's own `+++` header, drop a misleading `-n` — and four of those five added one more way for it to print nothing and exit 0, which is indistinguishable from "I checked and it was clean". The fifth was the other shape of the same disease: the `-n` it removed had been printing real hits with line numbers counted off the piped stream, so they looked authoritative and pointed nowhere — worse than silence, because a wrong answer outranks no answer. Either way the check kept shipping the defect it was written to catch. Prose cannot validate its own inputs, cannot say which of its outcomes occurred, and cannot be tested; a script does all three and its contract is that **every outcome is named and bad input fails loudly**. This is the Scripts check earlier in this same step, applied to this block — and the five rounds are what ignoring it costs.

**Read its verdict, not just its exit code.** The script exits 0 whenever it ran, so `$?` alone tells you nothing about what it found; the verdict line is where the answer is, and it always names one of: references found (resolve each), file identical to base, file changed but with no added lines, or added lines with nothing reference-shaped. Those are different results and the script keeps them different on purpose — the version of this check that collapsed them into one silent "nothing" is the reason it became a script. It costs seconds and does not depend on vigilance, which is what discipline #6 asks of any check worth writing. (It is a net, not a proof. Its blind spot is a pointer with no number in it — "see the section below", "as the rule above says" — so read the added lines too.)

### Step 5: Sanitization Review (mandatory for any public skill)

**Before this gate, when discipline #5 is due, its independent pass must have run**, and the current change's `independent-review.md` (in your private git-tracked knowledge repo — not the wiped workspace, not any repo that is or may become public or distributed) must exist **and be committed**. It is always due for a new skill; for an existing skill use the threshold in the next paragraph. A file sitting uncommitted in a git working directory is not meaningfully different from a file that was never written; `ls`/`test -f` confirms it is on disk, not that it survives. For a **new** skill this is the first step where anything leaves your hands, so it is where that discipline is actually enforced rather than merely stated — a rule that lives 1000 lines above the point of use, with nothing checking it, loses to completion-drive every time.

**For an edit to an already-published skill, the moment it leaves your hands is the push, not this step.** This gate can be answered "internal-only, skip" in one sentence, and packaging may never run at all for a docs-only change — so anchoring the review here means a skill edit can reach a public branch having passed no independent eye. Real case (2026-07): a change to this very file shipped a discovery command that could not reach three of the roots the prose beside it claimed it covered; it was merged, and only a review commissioned *afterwards* caught it. **So for an existing skill: the independent pass and its recorded artifact are due before `git push` / opening the PR — the gates that run at push (regression audit, validation, scans) all check structure, and none of them can tell you the instructions are wrong.** This inherits discipline #5's threshold unchanged: it is due when *a rule, contract, or number changed*, not for a typo or a pure reformat. Making a spelling fix wait on a review round would teach exactly the reflex #6 warns about — "this one's small" becomes the universal exemption, and then it covers the changes that mattered too.

**Not optional for a skill going to a public repo.** Private content leaks into public skills all the time, and the leaks a scanner misses are the dangerous ones — a real name in a non-English language, a verbatim line from a real transcript, a real example dropped into an illustration. Skip only if the skill is genuinely internal-only.

**Scope the pass by destination, not by topic.** Only the artifact that ships publicly — the skill bundle itself — gets sanitized. Companion documents that stay in a private repo (the incident report the skill was distilled from, internal runbooks, the project's CLAUDE.md) keep their real hostnames, paths, and timestamps: redacting those destroys their audit value, and you will end up reverting it. One distillation session went through three rounds of rework precisely because the redaction pass was applied to everything the source material touched instead of just the public skill.

**Check the destination first, and let it pre-fill the recommendation.** Run
`gh repo view --json isPrivate` on the repo the skill will live in (or read the note
`quick_validate` already printed). A private destination makes option C the default
recommendation rather than an afterthought — "assume public unless told otherwise" is
what turns a private skill's working paths into placeholders nobody asked for.

**The trigger for sanitizing is the destination's `isPrivate`, not how much the task
feels like publishing.** These come apart, and when they do the feeling wins unless you
name it. Moving content *into a marketplace skill* feels like publishing — marketplaces
are where things get distributed — so the sanitizing reflex fires even when both the
source and the destination are private repos and nothing is going anywhere. Real case
(2026-07): a migration from a project-level skill into a private marketplace skill
generalized a real config path, a real hex value and a real named example into
placeholders. `quick_validate` had printed `🔒 audience: private` on **every** run;
the author read it every time and sanitized anyway, because the *activity* read as
publication. The cost is not cosmetic — a real path is what lets the next reader go
check the value; "the project's own token file" cannot be opened.

So make it a lookup, not a judgment: **read `isPrivate` for the destination, and if it
is `true`, sanitizing requires the owner to ask for it.** A private→private move is a
move, not a release. **When neither probe answers** (no remote yet, `quick_validate` not
run), you have no lookup — fall back to treating it as public *and say so*, because the
asymmetry runs that way: an unnecessary question costs a sentence, an unnecessary leak
does not come back. And `isPrivate` reports the destination's state **today** — a skill
sitting in a private repo on its way to release gets its sanitization pass on the push
that publishes it, not on this one. If you find yourself reasoning about whether something "should"
be generalized in a private destination, that reasoning is the tell.

Use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm the depth (for a public destination, confirm the depth,
not whether to do it; for a private one, confirm whether it is wanted at all):

```
This skill will be public. I'll do a sanitization pass — the core of it is
me reading the whole skill and judging each name/example/snippet, because
scanners miss real content that has no keyword to match.

Options:
A) Full — I replace everything that looks lifted from a real project/person
B) Selective — I show you each finding and you decide (Recommended)
C) This skill is genuinely internal-only — skip
```

**Sanitization process — the read-through is the method, the scan is a helper:**

1. **Read the entire skill yourself and judge semantically** (this is the real check): SKILL.md + every reference + every example. For each concrete noun / example / snippet ask "generic-placeholder-or-public-entity, or lifted-from-a-real-project/person/transcript?" Replace the latter — even if no scanner flagged it. This is the only thing that catches no-keyword leaks. Full guidance + the semantic question in [references/sanitization_checklist.md](references/sanitization_checklist.md).
2. **Run scanners as a cheap first pass**: the checklist's grep patterns + `security_scan.py` (Step 6). They catch obvious secrets / paths / known names fast — but "no matches" is not a pass.
3. **Replace** each finding with a generic equivalent that keeps the teaching point (real name → public figure or `<placeholder>`, real snippet → `<placeholder>`). Two rules learned the hard way: the placeholder itself must not encode the real value — `<acme-corp-domain>` leaks exactly the name it was supposed to hide; name the *role* instead (`<api-domain>`, `<upstream-provider>`). And when you script a bulk replace, give it an explicit file whitelist scoped to the skill directory — an unscoped find-and-replace will happily rewrite the project's own CLAUDE.md and force a git restore.
4. **Verify by re-reading, not by re-grepping**: re-read the changed sections and confirm no broken references.

### Step 6: Security Review

Before packaging or distributing a skill, run the security scanner to detect hardcoded secrets and personal information:

```bash
# Required before packaging
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.security_scan <path/to/skill-folder>

# Verbose mode includes additional checks for paths, emails, and code patterns
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.security_scan <path/to/skill-folder> --verbose
```

**Detection coverage:**
- Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) via gitleaks
- Personal information (usernames, emails, company names) in verbose mode
- Unsafe code patterns (command injection risks) in verbose mode
- The complete shipping set is defined only by [scripts/packaging_policy.py](scripts/packaging_policy.py). Packaging, security attestation, content hashing, and regression auditing must consume that shared policy; do not maintain a second exclusion list in prose or in a consumer-specific filter.

**What it does NOT cover** — why Step 5's read-through is still required: gitleaks and the regex rules only match *known secret formats and patterns you listed*. They are structurally blind to private content with no keyword — a real person/project name in a non-English language, a verbatim line from a real transcript, a real example lifted from your own work. A green `security_scan` means "no known-format secret was found", **not** "the skill is sanitized". Never treat it as the latter.

**First-time setup:** Install gitleaks if not present:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gitleaks

# Linux/Windows - see script output for installation instructions
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` - Clean (safe to package)
- `1` - High severity issues
- `2` - Critical issues (MUST fix before distribution)
- `3` - gitleaks not installed
- `4` - Scan error

**In a private skill, a finding is information, not a work order.** The scanner cannot
tell a leaked credential from a credential that is *supposed* to be there — a template whose
whole value is that it comes pre-filled, a script pointing at the one machine it runs on.
Never auto-fix in a private repo: report what was found and let the owner choose. Option A
below ("fix automatically") is for skills headed somewhere public.

**If issues are found**, present them via **AskUserQuestion**:

```
Security scan found [N] issues in "[skill-name]":
- [SEVERITY] [file]: [description]
- ...

RECOMMENDATION: Fix automatically — these look like [accidental leaks / false positives].

Options:
A) Fix all issues automatically (Recommended)
B) Review each finding — let me decide per-item (some may be intentional)
C) Override and proceed — I accept the risk for internal distribution
```

### Step 7: Packaging a Skill

Once the skill is ready, package it into a distributable file:

```bash
cd <skill-creator-path>
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>
```

For every existing Git-tracked skill, packaging is blocked until the completed
review is supplied and re-verified. A current marker is only a local status receipt,
so committing first or hand-writing a marker cannot bypass the review. The review
becomes stale on the next edit:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.package_skill \
  <path/to/skill-folder> \
  --regression-review <workspace>/skill-regression-review.json
```

Optional output directory, and `--include-evals` to ship the root `evals/` directory (excluded by default as a development asset):

```bash
cd <skill-creator-path>
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist --include-evals
```

The packaging script will:

1. **Validate** the skill automatically (YAML frontmatter, naming conventions, path reference integrity)
2. **Re-verify the completed existing-skill regression review** whenever Git HEAD already contains the skill; a marker alone never authorizes packaging
3. **Verify security scan** (content hash must match last scan)
4. **Package** the skill into a distributable archive

If validation fails, the script reports errors and exits without creating a package.

### Step 8: Update Marketplace

After packaging, update the marketplace registry to include the new or updated skill.

**For new skills**, add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "skill-name",
  "description": "Copy from SKILL.md frontmatter description",
  "source": "./skill-name",
  "strict": false,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "category": "developer-tools",
  "keywords": ["relevant", "keywords"]
}
```

**For updated skills**, bump the version in `plugins[].version` following semver. Any change to a skill's **shipped** files — even a one-line typo fix — needs a bump: without it, `marketplace update` sees no new version, so **already-installed copies never refresh** and users keep running the old skill while your fix sits unshipped. Files that never ship are the one exception, and it is not a judgement call: `scripts/packaging_policy.py` defines that set and the repository's version gate consumes the same module, so a change confined to those paths is not a content change and needs no bump. Without that exception, retiring one local artifact would demand a release from every plugin that happened to carry one.

**Then record it in the changelog — this is the step that gets skipped.** The bump makes the
update *installable*; the entry is what makes it *findable* six months later, when someone
hits the same problem and greps for it. And a changelog that documents every other skill's
versions while silently dropping yours is worse than none at all: the gaps read as "nothing
changed there".

Match the existing entries' shape instead of inventing one — in a Keep-a-Changelog file that
is usually `- **skill-name** (\`suite\` vX.Y.Z): what broke, why, and what proves it fixed`.
Write it in the **same commit** as the bump; a changelog updated "later" is one that never
gets updated.

Real case (2026-08): two consecutive releases of one skill shipped with correct bumps, green
gates and merged PRs — and **no changelog entries at all**, because nothing in this procedure
asked for one. Both were caught only by a later audit. That is discipline #6 turned on this
file itself: a rule that lives in a convention rather than in a step loses to completion-drive
every time.

**Keep the registry diff minimal — it is the single file every skill shares.** A marketplace manifest is the one place where every concurrent editor collides, so an unrelated formatting change there is far more expensive than the same change anywhere else: it turns a clean three-line bump into a conflict for whoever else is mid-edit. When you script the update (parsing to JSON, mutating, writing back), the rewrite silently normalizes things the file may not have used — trailing newline, indent width, key order, unicode escaping. Round-trip discipline: re-read the file afterwards and run `git diff --stat` on it; **the only lines that may appear are the fields you meant to change.** If extra lines show up, restore the file's original convention rather than shipping the normalization (a scripted bump once added a trailing newline to a manifest that had never had one — one wasted diff line, in the file most likely to be edited by someone else at the same moment). The same instinct applies to any shared registry a skill touches: lockfiles, catalogs, index documents.

**When a PR outlives a few merges, rebase — then prove you didn't eat anyone's work.** The same property that makes the manifest a collision hotspot makes it the thing that goes stale: an open PR touching the registry and the changelog will conflict as soon as anything else lands, so expect `mergeable: CONFLICTING` rather than treating it as a surprise (one PR hit it after main moved 7 commits in an afternoon). Rebase rather than merge if the repo squash-merges — a merge commit in a squashed history buys nothing. The conflicts themselves are almost always **additive**: two authors each appended their own entry in the same section, so the resolution is to **keep both**, never `--ours`/`--theirs`, which silently discards a colleague's line.

The step people skip is the one that catches a bad resolution — **after resolving, prove the only difference from the base is yours:**

```bash
# Every version the base has vs. what your branch has; the diff must contain
# ONLY the entry you bumped. Anything else means the resolution ate someone's work.
uv run --project <skill-creator-path> --frozen python -c "
import json,subprocess
mine=json.load(open('<manifest>'))
base=json.loads(subprocess.run(['git','show','origin/main:<manifest>'],capture_output=True,text=True).stdout)
b={p['name']:p['version'] for p in base['plugins']}; m={p['name']:p['version'] for p in mine['plugins']}
print({k:(b.get(k),m.get(k)) for k in set(b)|set(m) if b.get(k)!=m.get(k)})"
```

Then push with `--force-with-lease`, never a bare `--force`: the lease makes the push fail if the remote moved since you last fetched, which is exactly the case where someone else pushed to your branch and a plain force would erase them.

**Plugin boundaries are not this skill's domain.** Whether to split skills into
separate plugins, how to lay out `source`/`skills`, and whether users can toggle
skills individually all belong to the packaging/distribution domain — the SSOT is
the `marketplace-dev` skill, not here. When a task actually needs those decisions:
ensure `marketplace-dev` is available (auto-install it if missing — the same way
`skill-reviewer` pulls in `skill-creator` when it needs its scripts), then read
marketplace-dev's cache-and-source-patterns reference and follow it. Don't restate
its rules here; a copy would drift.

**Renaming, relocating, or removing a marketplace entry is a breaking change** for
every user who already installed it — Claude Code does not clean up installed copies
when an entry disappears, leaving dangling installs that error on every `marketplace
update`. Treat such changes like an API deprecation: ship a migration note in the
changelog, and follow marketplace-dev's guidance for the mechanics.

For repositories with the local release gate installed, use
[release readiness](references/release-readiness.md) to bind committed review evidence
to the exact head before push. The gate checks persistence and coverage; it does not
replace the independent pass or determine whether a typo exemption is truthful.

**If you commit/push the skill repo yourself:** for an existing skill whose current change crosses discipline #5's rule/contract/number threshold, confirm the review artifact records this change and is committed (check its exact path with `git status` and `git log -1 -- <artifact>`, not merely whether some historical `independent-review.md` exists). A typo or pure reformat does not require that artifact; an older review never satisfies a current substantive change. Step 5's note explains why push, not packaging, is the real enforcement point for an already-published skill. Then stage only the skill's explicit paths (`git add <skill-dir> .claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) — never `git add .`; the working tree is usually full of unrelated churn that will otherwise ride into the commit (one commit swept in a pile of unrelated transcript files and had to be `git reset` and re-staged). Before pushing, confirm the repo's real visibility with `gh repo view --json visibility,isPrivate` instead of assuming from the path — a public skill repo deserves a PR + review, not a direct push to main.

### Step 9: Ship or Iterate

**When local availability is part of the requested delivery**, finish installation
and verify the target host before calling the Skill ready. Invoke `skill-governance`
and use its newly registered Skill checks. Supply the new Skill's identity from
this task, independently of the current activation whitelist; an omitted name
must not disappear from the expected set. For owned marketplaces approved for
automatic activation, use `claude-switch-models-setup` to sync the declared hosts.
Preserve explicit host-specific disables and existing router-only contracts.
Do not infer Claude availability from a Codex link, or installation from a
marketplace entry. A failed or unavailable host probe leaves local delivery
incomplete. Package-only and source-only requests retain their narrower scope.

After completing the skill, use **AskUserQuestion** to determine next steps:

```
Skill "[name]" is complete. Security scan passed, marketplace updated.

RECOMMENDATION: [pick based on state — e.g. "B) optimize the description" if triggering was never verified, else "D) done for now"] because [one-line reason].

Options:
A) Package and export as .skill file for distribution
B) Run description optimization — improve auto-triggering accuracy (~5 min)
C) Expand test set and iterate more — add edge cases before shipping
D) Done for now — I'll test it manually and come back if needed
```

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Refinement filter:** Only add what solves observed problems. If best practices already cover it, don't duplicate.

---

### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)

Check whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>
```

After packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.

## Claude.ai-specific instructions

In Claude.ai, use the same verification-depth router and heavy-eval authorization gate. When the full generic paired pipeline is explicitly authorized, the workflow is draft -> test -> review -> improve -> repeat, but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:

**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.

**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: "How does this look? Anything you'd change?"

**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.

**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.

**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.

**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.

**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.

- **Updating an existing skill**: The user might be asking you to update an existing skill, not create a new one. In this case:
  - **Preserve the original name.** Note the skill's directory name and `name` frontmatter field — use them unchanged. E.g., if the installed skill is `research-helper`, output `research-helper.skill` (not `research-helper-v2`).
  - **Copy to a writeable location before editing.** The installed skill path may be read-only. Copy it to `/tmp/skill-name/`, immediately create the audit tool's pre-edit snapshot from that writeable copy, then edit and package from the copy with `--regression-review`. Do not pass `--new-skill`; a non-Git copy of an existing skill is still an existing skill.
  - **If packaging manually, stage in `/tmp/` first**, then copy to the output directory — direct writes may fail due to permissions.

## Cowork-Specific Instructions

If you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:

- You have subagents, so an explicitly authorized generic paired pipeline can run baselines and graders. Their availability is not authorization and does not justify extra roles; state the necessary arms, cap concurrency, and run cases serially whenever parallelism adds no evidence.
- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.
- After an explicitly authorized **generic paired run**, generate the eval viewer for the human before revising the skill yourself, using `generate_review.py` rather than custom HTML. Default tier evidence, unauthorized work, and specialized workflows that replace viewer mechanics do not acquire a viewer obligation merely because the work happens in Cowork.
- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's "Submit All Reviews" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).
- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.
- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.
- **Updating an existing skill**: The user might be asking you to update an existing skill, not create a new one. Follow the update guidance in the claude.ai section above.

## Reference files

The agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.

- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs
- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs
- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another

The references/ directory has additional documentation:
- `references/eval_pipeline_schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, benchmark.json, etc.
- `references/sanitization_checklist.md` — Checklist for sanitizing business-specific content before public distribution

The scripts/ directory includes deterministic gates used by this workflow:
- `scripts/audit_skill_regression.py` — compares an immutable old skill bundle
  with the edited bundle, creates an explicit disposition review, and verifies
  its hashes/evidence before packaging an existing skill.
- `scripts/reference_net.sh` — lists the prose cross-references among the lines you
  added, for the Reference-and-self-application check in Step 4 (Edit the Skill). Its own header is
  contract: what it covers, what it deliberately leaves to `lychee`, and why it takes a
  base ref rather than `HEAD`.

---

Repeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:

- Figure out what the skill is about
- For an existing skill, snapshot and inventory the old bundle before editing
- Select the lowest verification tier that can falsify this change before taking any specialized workflow exit, and record why
- Draft or edit the skill
- Run the evidence required by that tier or the selected specialized workflow's declared equivalent mechanics
- For an explicitly authorized generic paired run, evaluate the outputs with the user, create `benchmark.json`, and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py`
- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied
- Run and clear the existing-skill regression review; eval-only survival does not count
- Package the final skill and return it to the user.
- Apply the outcome-presentation decision: show verified change and remaining choices in chat, or open a visual report when that helps the user inspect the result.

Please add the selected verification tier and its default evidence to your TodoList, if you have one. Add "Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases" only after the generic paired pipeline is explicitly authorized.

Good luck!
