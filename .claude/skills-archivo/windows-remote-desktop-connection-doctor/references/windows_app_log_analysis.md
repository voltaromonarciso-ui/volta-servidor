## Log File Locations

### macOS

```
~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.rdc.macos/Data/Library/Logs/Windows App/
```

Files follow the pattern:
```
com.microsoft.rdc.macos_v<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HH-mm-ss>.log
```

A new log file is created each day or when the app restarts. Multiple files may exist — sort by modification time to find the most recent:

```bash
ls -lt ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.rdc.macos/Data/Library/Logs/Windows\ App/
```

**Timestamps are UTC.** Windows App logs on macOS are written in UTC. Convert them to the user's local timezone before comparing with Windows Event logs, screenshots, or the user's description of when the problem occurred.

## Startup Health Check Block

When the Windows App launches, it runs a health check sequence. A healthy startup produces entries in this order:

```
Passed: InternetConnectivity
0: 1
4: 3
AvcDecodingCheck: 0
HardwarePresenterCheck: 0
AvcHwDecodingCheck: 1
4: 4
TCP/IP Traffic Routed Through VPN: No
STUN/TURN Traffic Routed Through VPN: Yes
```

Followed by gateway reachability tests:

```
Passed URL: https://afdfp-rdgateway-r1.wvd.microsoft.com/ Attempts Made: 1 Used Ipv4: 1 HTTP Status Code: 200 Response Time: 480
Passed URL: https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/ Attempts Made: 1 Used Ipv4: 1 HTTP Status Code: 200 Response Time: 613
```

### What Each Entry Means

| Entry | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Passed: InternetConnectivity` | General internet reachability confirmed |
| `AvcDecodingCheck` / `AvcHwDecodingCheck` | Hardware video decoding capability (0=unavailable, 1=available) |
| `HardwarePresenterCheck` | Hardware presentation capability |
| `TCP/IP Traffic Routed Through VPN` | Whether the client detects a VPN intercepting TCP traffic |
| `STUN/TURN Traffic Routed Through VPN` | Whether the client detects a VPN intercepting STUN/TURN (UDP) traffic |
| `Passed URL: ...` | Gateway reachability test with response time in ms |

### When Health Check Fails

If the startup health check block is **completely absent** from a log, the diagnostic subsystem itself failed. Check for certificate validation errors near the log start:

```
DIAGNOSTICS(ERR): Failed to validate X509CertificateChain, certificate is not trusted.
BASIX_DCT(ERR): OSSLClosingException thrown, msg=Certificate validation failed
```

This indicates TLS interception (common with ISP HTTPS proxies in China) or DNS poisoning affecting Microsoft diagnostic endpoints.

## Transport Negotiation Entries

### FetchClientOptions

This is the critical function that retrieves transport capabilities from the gateway:

```
GATEWAY(ERR): CWVDTransport::FetchClientOptions exception when attempting to fetch client options: Request timed out
    wvd_transport.cpp(521): FetchClientOptions()
```

When this times out, the client cannot discover available transport options (including Shortpath). The connection will fall back to WebSocket.

### ClientOptions Controller

A separate mechanism that refreshes client properties:

```
ClientOptions_Controller(ERR): ClientOptionsController RefreshProperties attempt 1 failed: Request timed out. Retrying in 30s...
    client_options.cpp(214): RefreshProperties()
```

This is less critical than `FetchClientOptions` but indicates general connectivity issues to Microsoft configuration services.

### WebRTC Session

```
A3CORE(ERR): OnRDWebRTCRedirectorRpc rtcSession not handled
```

This appears when the server sends a WebRTC session setup but the client does not process it. This may indicate incomplete Shortpath support in the client version, or a session setup that arrives after fallback.

Note: `OnRDWebRTCRedirectorRpc notifyClipRectChanged not handled` is a benign clipboard-related message, not transport-related.

## Error Signatures

### Certificate Validation Failure

```
DIAGNOSTICS(ERR): Failed to validate X509CertificateChain, certificate is not trusted.
A3CORE(ERR): ITrustDelegateAdaptorPtr is empty.
BASIX_DCT(ERR): OSSLClosingException thrown, msg=Certificate validation failed, ossl error string="error:00000000:lib(0)::reason(0)", closing error code=1002
```

**Cause**: TLS certificate for Microsoft diagnostic endpoints is not trusted. Common with ISP HTTPS proxies/MITM, DNS poisoning, or corporate proxy servers.

**Impact**: Prevents the diagnostic health check from completing, which may block transport capability discovery.

### Channel Write Failures

```
"-legacy-"(ERR): Channel::StartWrite failed
"-legacy-"(ERR): GetBuffer failed
```

Multiple consecutive `StartWrite failed` or `GetBuffer failed` errors indicate a connection disruption — the WebSocket or TCP connection to the gateway was interrupted. This is typically followed by a reconnection attempt. On direct PC connections, this pattern appears after the remote PC reboots or the network path changes.

### Diagnostics Flush Errors

```
DIAGNOSTICS(ERR): FlushTracesInternal() is called before BeginUpload(). we don't have a claims token yet
```

This is a benign telemetry error — the diagnostics system tried to upload traces before authentication completed. Does NOT affect connection quality.

### Connection Monitor Drop

```
RDP_WAN: Client connMonitor goto CMSTATE_DROPPED (total-missed=12)....try reconnect!
```

The client's connection monitor declared the session dead after missing ~12 heartbeats. This is a **symptom** of a network drop or server reboot. If you see this immediately followed by reconnect failures, check whether the remote Windows PC rebooted (see `references/direct_pc_and_auth_diagnostics.md`).

### OneAuth / Microsoft Account Token Errors

These signatures appear when a signed-in Microsoft work/school account cannot refresh its token. They can poison even direct PC connections.

```
OneAuthError_InteractionRequired
No valid refresh tokens available in the cache
AcquireTokenInteractively
Exception during credentials callback!: credential completion has been canceled
User canceled sign in
GATEWAY(ERR): CWVDTransport::OnOrchestrationHttpError error: UserCancelled(8)
Fail OnDisconnected call
```

See `references/direct_pc_and_auth_diagnostics.md` for the full diagnostic and fix.

### MCS Connect Non-Fatal Error

```
rdpstack.cpp(...): ParseUserData: No data of type 0xc09
```

This appears in both successful and failed sessions. It means the server did not include an optional user data block in the MCS Connect Response, but the client continued. Its presence is **non-fatal** and actually proves the server answered the MCS Connect phase.

### Live Session Input Events

```
IHAddMouseEventToPDU
IHAddMouseWheelEventToPDU
IHAddKeyboardEventToPDU
```

These appear when a session is connected and receiving input. Persistent mouse/keyboard events after a "connected" entry mean the session is healthy, even if a stale progress dialog is still visible on another display or Space.

## Comparing Working vs Broken Sessions

The most effective diagnostic approach: compare a log from when the connection was healthy (UDP transport) with the current broken log.

### Quick Comparison Script

```bash
LOG_DIR=~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.rdc.macos/Data/Library/Logs/Windows\ App

echo "=== Health check and transport entries per log file ==="
for f in "$LOG_DIR"/*.log; do
  echo ""
  echo "--- $(basename "$f") ---"
  grep -c "InternetConnectivity" "$f" 2>/dev/null | xargs -I{} echo "  InternetConnectivity checks: {}"
  grep "Routed Through VPN" "$f" 2>/dev/null | head -2 | sed 's/^/  /'
  grep "Passed URL:" "$f" 2>/dev/null | head -2 | sed 's/^/  /'
  grep "FetchClientOptions" "$f" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  grep "Certificate validation failed" "$f" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | sed 's/^/  /'
done
```

### What to Compare

| Aspect | Working (UDP) | Broken (WebSocket) |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Health check block | Present, complete | Missing or incomplete |
| `TCP/IP Routed Through VPN` | Present | Missing |
| `STUN/TURN Routed Through VPN` | Present | Missing |
| `Passed URL:` | Present with response times | Missing |
| `FetchClientOptions` | No error | Timeout error |
| Certificate errors | None at startup | Present at startup |

## Filtering Noise

Windows App logs contain many repetitive entries that obscure useful information. Filter these out:

```bash
grep -v -E "BasicStateManagement|DynVC.*SendChannelClose|dynvcstat.*SerializeToJson|asynctransport\.cpp|FlushTracesInternal"
```

### Common Noise Patterns

| Pattern | What It Is | Safe to Filter |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| `~BasicStateManagement()` | Transport object destructor | Yes |
| `SendChannelClose()` | Dynamic virtual channel cleanup | Yes |
| `SerializeToJson()` | Channel stats serialization | Yes |
| `FlushTracesInternal()` | Telemetry upload attempt | Yes |
| `Stateful object ... destructed while in state Opened` | Abrupt connection close | Context-dependent |

The last pattern (`Stateful object destructed in Opened state`) may be significant during active troubleshooting — it indicates connections being torn down unexpectedly. Keep it when investigating disconnection events.

## Activity ID Tracking

Each RDP session gets a unique activity ID (GUID). Track a specific session through the log:

```bash
# Find activity IDs from connection events
grep -E "\{[0-9a-f]{8}-" "$LOG_FILE" | grep -v "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" | head -5

# Trace a specific session
grep "<activity-id>" "$LOG_FILE" | grep -v "BasicStateManagement\|FlushTraces"
```

The null GUID `{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}` indicates background/system events, not specific RDP sessions.
