# load_census.sh — three-readings process census for macOS load triage.
# Read-only. BSD ps (macOS stock) only; no GNU flags, no third-party tools.
#
# Reading 1 (PPID aggregation): who is accumulating children — a leak hides
#   here; while the parent lives, the children never orphan, so nothing else
#   will ever clean them.
# Reading 2 (cumulative CPU time): who has been burning for hours/days — the
#   busy loop that instantaneous %CPU dilutes.
# Reading 3 (instantaneous %CPU): who is burning right now — the active storm.
#
# Usage: bash load_census.sh [topN]   (topN defaults to 12)
