# macOS Watchdog

A watchdog is a launchd job that periodically detects a recurring problem and remediates it without a human. The craft is not "how to install a plist" — it is **how to keep the watchdog from becoming a new disturbance**: every watchdog on this machine was born from an incident, and the recurring failure mode afterward is the watchdog itself (false "all good" reports, notification floods, re-launching apps the user quit, fork-bomb replays).

The governing principle, learned the expensive way: **a watchdog's lifecycle is bound to its premise state**. When the condition it exists to fix cannot be fixed by it (broken WiFi, user quit the target app, prerequisite state gone), the watchdog must stand down *by itself* — not wait for a human to disable it.

## The quiet-watchdog contract

Before shipping or blessing any watchdog, every clause below must hold. Each clause exists because a real watchdog violated it.

### 1. Premise-state self-check — it knows when it has no job

The script's first act on every run: verify the state that justifies its existence still holds. If not, exit silently — no remediation, no notification, no side effects.

- A proxy-repair watchdog checks the proxy app is running first; user quit it → skip the cycle.
- A "did the config switch back" watcher checks the config state it watches; already switched → self-stop, not another round of misleading notifications. (Real case: a recovery watcher kept firing for 2h after its premise resolved, sending 3 spurious notices, because nothing told it to stop.)

### 2. Remediate first, page only on sustained failure

Detection stays honest on every cycle, but the *disruptive action* defers until the failure persists across N consecutive cycles (patient mode). Rationale: oscillating chains self-recover in minutes; a force-reconnect on a self-limiting blip is net-harmful. Measure your system's real self-recovery window before choosing N (one chain's 94-min observatory run showed ≤3 min self-recovery → N=2 cycles at 5-min interval).

When the trigger aggregates several independent sources into one verdict (not a single health check), the cross-source agreement fraction is a *second, separate* parameter from N — don't default to "all sources must agree." An all-or-nothing gate produces a false negative on exactly the correlated-but-partial incident the watchdog exists to catch, because real failures rarely take every source down at once (real case: a 9-source collection-health gate required 9/9 failing and missed a live incident sitting at 6/9; recalibrating against the actual incident data to a ≥60%-of-sources threshold caught it while three-fixture testing at 0%/11%/100% confirmed it still tolerated a single-source blip). Calibrate breadth (what fraction must agree) against real historical failure data the same way you calibrate depth (N) — a threshold picked from what "sounds strict enough" is a guess, not a calibration.

Escalation ladder (cheap → disruptive): refresh state → restart connection → remote repair. Each rung verifies before climbing.

### 3. Escalating auto-cooldown — an unfixable environment means silence

When the full repair ladder fails, the environment is unfixable by the watchdog (broken WiFi, captive portal, dead upstream). The naive behavior — re-run the entire ladder + notification every interval forever — is exactly "the watchdog keeps re-launching the app every 10 minutes."

`ThrottleInterval` does **not** fix this: it throttles process respawn, is a fixed delay with no backoff, and does nothing for a job that exits 0 after spamming. Cool-down must live in the application layer:

- Record consecutive exhausted rounds in a state file.
- After each exhausted round, stand down for an escalating tier (e.g. 30 min → 2 h → 6 h, last tier repeats).
- One notification when *entering* cool-down; zero during it. On tier expiry, retry one round; any real heal clears the counter and the cool-down state.
- A manual `pause [duration]` command with a TTL state file is the fallback — but the auto path must work with no human command at all. A disable mechanism that requires the user to remember a command is not a mechanism.

Reusable implementation: `scripts/watchdog-cooldown.sh` (source it; provides `paused_any`, `record_exhausted`, `clear_exhausted`, `cmd_pause`/`cmd_resume`).

### 4. Never resurrect what the user explicitly quit

On macOS, `open <url-scheme>` **launches the app** when it isn't running, and `open` without `-g` steals foreground. A watchdog whose remediation uses URL schemes (or `open -a`, or restarting a GUI app) will read to the user as "I quit it and it came back."

Gate every such action: check the target process is alive before invoking its scheme, and pass `-g` so a legitimate action never pops a window. If the user quit the app mid-remediation, abort the ladder — cleanup traps must honor the same gate, or the "ensure connected on exit" fallback becomes the resurrector.

## Deploy (mechanics that bite)

Before deploying or integrating an existing periodic observer, apply
`references/probe-cost.md`. Require bounded observation work and a completed native
launchd round; importing an existing script does not certify its cost or verdict.

1. **Location**: user agent → `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (GUI session context: can `open` apps, show notifications); system daemon → `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` (root, no GUI access). Choose by whether the job needs the user's GUI session, not by habit.
2. **plist**: start from `assets/launchagent.template.plist` (annotated: Label, ProgramArguments, StartInterval, StandardOutPath/StandardErrorPath, ThrottleInterval, Nice). Validate with `plutil -lint`. `ProgramArguments` element 0 = absolute path; never rely on PATH inheritance.
3. **Load/reload**: `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) <plist>`; after editing a plist, `bootout` then `bootstrap` again — launchd's active state must match disk. Force one run with `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/<label>`.
4. **Logs**: `StandardOutPath`/`StandardErrorPath` are non-negotiable (without them failures vanish), plus in-script log rotation (cap ~1 MB).
5. **Idempotency guard**: re-running your deploy must not double-install. `scripts/new-launchagent.sh <label> <script> <interval>` is the idempotent wrapper (bootout-if-loaded → write plist → bootstrap → verify `launchctl list`).
6. **TCC / Full Disk Access**: a LaunchAgent reading protected files needs a working grant for its effective permission subject. Use `macos-permissions` to inspect TCC attribution and verify a protected read from the actual job; the shell's interpreter path alone does not decide this.
7. **Batch throttling by default**: any watchdog loop that spawns work (replays, fuzz, batch scans, parallel API calls) needs an explicit rate cap as a default parameter, not a later optimization. To the machine, an unthrottled loop and a runaway process are indistinguishable (real case: an unthrottled test replay forked 1,041 processes/sec for 7 minutes and pushed the die to 83 °C).
8. **Browser side-effect acceptance**: a successful data fetch alone does not prove a browser-backed watchdog is ready. The deploying operator must declare a budget for task-owned spaces and pages, then independently inventory them across multiple rounds, including injected initialization and cleanup failures. Counts must stay within that lifecycle budget; protect user-owned and unknown-origin pages throughout. If the task requires no focus stealing, independently observe the foreground app and visible windows during those rounds; CDP success is not focus evidence. For ego lite lifecycle, locking, ownership conflicts and cleanup readback, load the named Skill `ego-lite-use` when installed. Otherwise use the owning browser tool's documented lifecycle while meeting the same budget and readback requirements. Missing resource observations, or missing focus observations when no focus stealing is required, leave acceptance incomplete.

## Stop semantics (the deprecated trap)

| Intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Stop now, allow re-bootstrap later | `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/<label>` (daemon: `sudo launchctl bootout system/<label>`) |
| Stop now AND keep stopped across login | `launchctl disable user/$(id -u)/<label>` (reverse: `enable`) |
| Edit then reload | `bootout` → edit plist → `bootstrap` |

**Never `launchctl unload`**: deprecated, and on Ventura+ the job re-loads via `RunAtLoad` when the plist stays in place — the "disabled" watchdog fires again (observed: an `unload`ed watcher re-firing 3 times in 2h). `bootstrap`/`bootout` are the modern pair.

## Troubleshooting quick map

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| "It re-launches the app I quit" | URL-scheme/`open` calls missing the process-alive gate (clause 4) |
| "It spams the same repair every few minutes" | No exhausted-round cool-down (clause 3); also check the ladder's failure path doesn't reset its dead-counter |
| "It reports healthy through a real outage" | Health check certifies only the path it probes — one green probe ≠ all planes healthy (add the second plane's probe) |
| "bootout didn't stick / it came back" | `unload` used instead of `bootout`, or `RunAtLoad` + plist still in place |
| Silent no-runs | `StandardErrorPath` missing → failures invisible; then `log show --predicate 'process == "launchd"' --last 15m` |
| "log mtime is fresh" but the job is actually failing | out.log all-green is **not** health — a failed pass may write nothing (`set -e` + prints-verified-only-on-success), so the last-success timestamp stays fresh forever. Judge the **failure** path (err.log / last-exit status), not success-side freshness (Pattern 7) |
| Works interactively, fails under launchd | TCC/FDA on the wrong interpreter; PATH assumptions in `ProgramArguments` |
| Observation becomes slower as history grows | Audit cold, warm and delta work using `references/probe-cost.md`; caching bytes does not bound parsing or queries |
