# GitHub Operations

Deliver the requested GitHub state, not a successful-looking command. A `200`, `201`,
`202`, or `204` response is evidence that GitHub accepted a request; it is not proof
that every requested field changed, an invitation was accepted, an asynchronous job
finished, or the user's business outcome was achieved.

## Route by operation

Read only the reference required for the task:

| Task | Reference |
|---|---|
| Create, review, merge, close, compare, or converge PRs; clear approved PR body revisions; retire remote PR branches | [`references/pr_operations.md`](references/pr_operations.md) |
| Create, edit, search, transfer, close, or bulk-manage issues | [`references/issue_operations.md`](references/issue_operations.md) |
| Inspect, clone, create, edit, rename, archive, transfer, change visibility, or delete repositories | [`references/repository_operations.md`](references/repository_operations.md) |
| Copy repositories accessible to another account while keeping the usual account active; configure private copies and upstream sync | [`references/multi_account_repository_sync.md`](references/multi_account_repository_sync.md) |
| Inspect or change collaborators, teams, base permissions, member privileges, or organization 2FA | [`references/organization_access_and_settings.md`](references/organization_access_and_settings.md) |
| Protect a default branch while letting collaborators contribute through PRs | [`references/branch_protection.md`](references/branch_protection.md) |
| Trigger, inspect, rerun, cancel, or purge Actions; manage secrets or variables | [`references/workflow_operations.md`](references/workflow_operations.md) |
| Build and publish a Docker/OCI image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) | [`references/ghcr_publishing.md`](references/ghcr_publishing.md) |
| Use raw REST/GraphQL endpoints, pagination, rate limits, webhooks, or Enterprise hosts | [`references/api_reference.md`](references/api_reference.md) |
| Build scripts, retries, bulk operations, or machine-readable output | [`references/best_practices.md`](references/best_practices.md) |

For local Git recovery, dirty worktrees, bundles, or lost commits, use `git-safety-net`.
This skill owns GitHub-hosted state.
For repository copies, also handle per-remote authentication and sync setup.

## Universal operating contract

### 1. Classify the request before touching GitHub

- **Answer, inspect, diagnose, or review:** read-only. Do not create a PR, issue,
  comment, invitation, workflow run, or setting change.
- **Create, change, merge, close, grant, revoke, publish, or delete:** the named
  state change is authorized. Keep the target and blast radius inside that request.
- **Destructive, public, credential-related, production-triggering, or externally
  communicative:** require the exact target, consequence, and recovery path. If the
  user did not provide a material choice such as repository owner, visibility, or
  message content, stop before the write.

Do not turn a read-only investigation into a mutation because the fix looks obvious.
Do not send a comment, review, issue, or invitation whose recipient or content was not
authorized in the current task.

For an authorized contributor, assess repository access against their ongoing contribution
role, not just today's read or sync command. Repository Write access and permission to update
the default branch are separate decisions. Follow the user's chosen contribution scope; use
branch protection and PR review to control integration rather than silently reducing a
contributor to Read. A diagnosis alone still does not authorize a grant.

### 2. Bind identity, host, and target

Before the first write, verify the active account and resolve a fully qualified target:

```bash
gh auth status --hostname HOST
gh api --hostname HOST user --jq '.login'
gh repo view HOST/OWNER/REPO \
  --json nameWithOwner,visibility,isPrivate,viewerPermission,url
```

For `github.com`, `OWNER/REPO` is sufficient. Never use `gh auth status --show-token`
for routine diagnosis, and never print, paste, or log a token.

Before the first push to a remote in the current session, read its live visibility:

```bash
gh repo view OWNER/REPO \
  --json nameWithOwner,visibility,isPrivate,stargazerCount,forkCount,url
```

Bind identity to the interface that will perform the write. CLI identity does
not establish a connector, browser, REST client, or Git SSH identity. Resolve the
expected actor from the user's authorized task; neither the repository owner nor
an available credential selects that actor automatically. For connectors, use a
read-only current-user operation from that same connector and confirm its actor.
If that interface cannot expose the actor, use the already verified CLI channel
for the authorized write; do not make a test comment to discover its identity.

For authorized `gh` API/hosted-state writes, use the bundled checked invocation.
Resolve `<github-ops-dir>` to the directory containing this SKILL.md; run the
helper by that path from the task's working directory. Its executable argument
and rejection contract is [checked_gh.py](scripts/checked_gh.py).

```bash
uv run python <github-ops-dir>/scripts/checked_gh.py --expected-login <EXPECTED_LOGIN> --host HOST
uv run python <github-ops-dir>/scripts/checked_gh.py --expected-login <EXPECTED_LOGIN> --host HOST -- pr edit <NUMBER> -R OWNER/REPO --title '<AUTHORIZED_TITLE>'
```

The first command is read-only. The second resolves the current credential,
checks `GET /user`, and pins that same credential for one command. A mismatch or
unknown actor exits before execution. It guards only `gh`, not connector calls,
browser actions or Git pushes. Authentication/configuration commands are rejected;
task authorization, exact targets and independent readback remain required.
Supply `-R OWNER/REPO` for repository-scoped commands, or an explicit repository
operand for `gh repo`. The wrapper qualifies that target with the checked host,
removes inherited `GH_REPO` and alternate token variables from the child, and
rejects conflicting host operands. Omit the command for an identity-only read.
Organization secret/variable operations instead use their explicit `--org`
scope; personal Codespaces secrets use `--user`. Body/title/field values remain
unchanged even when they resemble flags or URLs. Public API absolute URLs use
`api.github.com`; relative API endpoints remain supported.
Switching account, credential, host or interface invalidates earlier identity
evidence. Recheck before the next write; do not reuse a prior session's pass.

Reference examples show native `gh` operation syntax. Execute hosted-state
mutations by passing those arguments after the helper's `--`, with an explicit
repository or account scope; bare `gh` remains suitable for readback and
separately authorized authentication/configuration. When a builtin's operand
shape is rejected, use its supported explicit REST/GraphQL equivalent through
the same helper; do not bypass the actor check. A failed or timed-out invocation
does not prove the mutation was absent: read the exact target before retrying.

For incident attribution, preserve event ID/time, actor and interface separately
from the ChatGPT execution account. A comment author's `login` and
`performed_via_github_app` establish GitHub actor/application, not the ChatGPT
email. A session's creator identity and today's auth file do not establish its
historical execution account. Keep missing links unknown.

### 3. Read current authority and preview the delta

Use GitHub-hosted state, not a stale local ref or remembered setting. Capture only the
fields required to prove the requested transition. Before a consequential write, make
this plan explicit:

```text
Target: fully qualified repository, organization, PR, issue, run, or account
Current: authoritative fields and immutable IDs/SHAs
Requested: exact field or state transition
Blast radius: people, repositories, forks, runs, or public surfaces affected
Recovery: exact inverse operation or explicit “not recoverable”
Readback: independent GET/CLI query and expected result
```

If the user already authorized this exact consequence, execute it. Do not add a
ceremonial second confirmation. If target, scope, public exposure, deletion, recipient,
or recovery remains ambiguous, pause before the write.

### 4. Choose an interface whose input contract actually supports the change

Prefer, in order:

1. a purpose-built `gh` subcommand;
2. a documented REST endpoint for one resource or authoritative readback;
3. GraphQL when the required mutation/query is GraphQL-only or combines related data;
4. the documented GitHub UI when the setting has no supported API input.

Response fields are not automatically writable fields. Before using `PATCH`, compare
the desired key against the operation's current **request body parameters**, not the
shape returned by `GET`. GitHub may ignore an unsupported key while still returning a
successful response. Do not switch API families merely to make the command run.

Use explicit methods with `gh api`. Adding `-f` or `-F` changes the default method to
`POST`; filtered GET requests must include `-X GET`.

### 5. Mutate once; do not retry ambiguity

- Pin repository, object number, branch, run ID, username, and expected SHA where the
  operation supports it.
- Do not blindly retry non-idempotent writes such as comments, invitations, workflow
  dispatches, releases, or PR/issue creation. After a timeout or 5xx, read back first to
  determine whether the first request landed.
- For bulk changes, freeze and display the finite target list, then process one target
  at a time with per-item results. Never pipe an unreviewed live query directly into a
  destructive `xargs` command.
- Do not bypass repository hooks, required checks, branch protections, signatures, or
  visibility-consequence acknowledgements.

### 6. Verify through an independent readback

Run a fresh read that does not trust the mutation response or a cached local ref:

| Mutation | Required acceptance evidence |
|---|---|
| PR merge/close/edit | PR state plus accepted behavior on the fetched base when landing matters |
| Branch deletion | Hosted branch/ref is absent; local remote-tracking cleanup is a separate check |
| Issue/comment/review | Exact object exists once with the intended state/content |
| Repository create/edit/visibility | Fully qualified repository readback matches owner, visibility, and requested fields |
| Collaborator/team permission | Invitation state if pending, then effective permission; also identify remaining base/team grants when revoking |
| Organization setting | A fresh organization/settings read returns every requested field; UI-only settings require UI readback plus any available API signal |
| 2FA requirement | Preflight affected accounts, UI confirmation, API readback, then membership/outside-collaborator audit |
| Workflow dispatch/rerun/cancel | The intended run ID reaches the expected state; command acceptance is not completion |
| Secret/variable change | Metadata and consumer behavior, never secret value disclosure |

For asynchronous state, poll with a bounded deadline and report `pending` if the terminal
state is not observed. If readback differs, report `failed/no-op` or `partially applied`,
show the mismatched fields, and keep recovery available. Never say “done” from the write
receipt alone.

### 7. Report the business outcome

End with one of four honest states:

- **changed and verified** — requested state is independently observed;
- **already satisfied** — no write was necessary;
- **pending** — accepted but not yet terminal, with the next authoritative check;
- **failed/no-op or partial** — requested and observed states differ, with recovery and
  unresolved risk.

### 8. Authenticate only for the named write

Authentication is scoped to the authorized operation; it is not a reason to reopen an
already-authorized exact write. Before starting an interactive browser or device flow, state
the GitHub application, active account, target host, and the exact permission delta. Continue
the steps the browser can complete after that explanation. Hand control to the user only when
their physical presence is required, such as MFA, a hardware key, or an account-selection
decision. Never request broader scopes, a different account, or an unrelated approval merely
because the normal flow is interactive.

Do not expose credential values in terminal output, URLs, arguments, committed files, or
reports. A production host's pull-only registry credential is not authorization to publish.
Reuse the current, already-authorized credential when it has been verified for the exact write;
use a temporary local Docker configuration and remove that configuration after the operation.
GHCR publication has its own preflight and digest readback; load
`references/ghcr_publishing.md` before building or pushing an image.

## High-impact boundaries

- Repository creation requires an explicit `OWNER/REPO` and visibility. Never default
  a generic example to `--public`; public exposure is a product decision.
- Repository visibility changes can expose code, Actions logs, artifacts, forks, and
  history. Use `gh repo edit --visibility ... --accept-visibility-change-consequences`
  only after the consequences and exact repository are authorized, then read back.
- Merges, branch deletions, repository creation/deletion/transfer/visibility changes,
  organization-wide permissions, 2FA enforcement, and secret rotation require their
  operation-specific reference.
- PR and issue title formats are repository policy. Inspect templates, contribution
  guidance, checks, or an accepted recent example; do not invent a universal JIRA prefix.
- Enterprise policy can override organization or repository controls. Preserve `HOST`
  explicitly and report when a lower layer cannot change the enforced state.

## Safe read-only quick reference

```bash
gh pr list -R OWNER/REPO --state open --json number,title,state,url
gh pr view 123 -R OWNER/REPO --json number,title,state,headRefOid,baseRefOid,url
gh issue list -R OWNER/REPO --state open --json number,title,state,url
gh workflow list -R OWNER/REPO
gh run list -R OWNER/REPO --limit 20 \
  --json databaseId,status,conclusion,headSha,url
gh api -X GET 'repos/OWNER/REPO/branches?per_page=100' --paginate --jq '.[].name'
```

Use `--json`/`--jq` for decisions. Human-formatted output is for reading, not parsing.
