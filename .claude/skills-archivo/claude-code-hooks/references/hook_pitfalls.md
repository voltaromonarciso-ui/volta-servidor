# Hook Pitfalls — real failure modes, symptom → cause → fix

Every entry here is a bug that shipped. When a hook misbehaves, match the
**symptom** first — the cause is rarely where you'd look.

---

## 1. Hook silently allows everything (stdin consumed by heredoc)

- **Symptom:** the hook is registered, `bash -n` passes, but it never blocks —
  every case exits 0, including obvious triggers. Your test table is all-green on
  the "allow" rows and all-wrong on the "block" rows.
- **Cause:** you fed the python via `python3 - <<'PY' … PY`. That heredoc IS the
  script and consumes **stdin**, so the hook's JSON event never reaches python —
  `json.load(sys.stdin)` reads the script text, throws, and a defensive
  `except: sys.exit(0)` turns the crash into "allow everything."
- **Fix:** read stdin in bash into a var, pass it to python via an **env var**:
  ```bash
  INPUT=$(cat)
  HOOK_JSON="$INPUT" python3 - <<'PY'
  import os, json
  data = json.loads(os.environ.get("HOOK_JSON") or "{}")
  PY
  ```
  (Shipped in qlmanage-guard 2026-07-21; caught because the test table's block
  rows all read exit 0.)

---

## 2. Hook false-blocks a healthy command (awk-split ignores shell quoting)

- **Symptom:** a plain command gets blocked — e.g. `grep -E "a|TRIGGER|b" file`
  is stopped even though it only *searches* for the word, doesn't execute it.
  Often the hook's *very first real use* is a false-block.
- **Cause:** the hook split the raw command string on shell separators with awk
  (`gsub(/&&|\|\||;|\|/,"\n")`). awk doesn't understand shell quoting, so the `|`
  *inside the quoted regex* is treated as a pipe, the string splits, and
  `TRIGGER` lands at a segment head → looks like a command.
- **Fix:** tokenize with the **`shlex.shlex` class** (`punctuation_chars=True`,
  `whitespace_split=True`) — NOT the `shlex.split()` function (the `ls|TRIGGER x`
  divergence is measured in [hook_patterns.md](hook_patterns.md#the-shlex-command-position-walker),
  whose code comments carry it verbatim). Then check **command
  position**, not mere presence — walker in
  [hook_patterns.md](hook_patterns.md#the-shlex-command-position-walker).
- **Caveat — `whitespace_split=True` also swallows newlines.** If your commands
  can be multiline (`cd x\ngit add\ngit push`), tokenizing the whole string
  collapses every line into one segment and hides everything but the first line's
  head. Split on newlines as text *first*; see #11.
- **Why this is the worst class of bug:** *误杀健康输入比漏报更糟* — a guard that
  blocks healthy input trains the operator (human or model) to bypass it
  reflexively, and a reflexively-bypassed guard protects nothing. When choosing
  between over- and under-matching, **bias to under** (miss a rare case) rather
  than over (block a common healthy one).

---

## 3. A corrupted hook poisons the ENTIRE session

- **Symptom:** after you install/edit a hook, *unrelated* Bash calls start
  failing weirdly — output truncated or duplicated, commands that clearly ran
  reported as failed, `git log` showing commits that don't exist, `mv` "errors"
  that didn't happen. It feels like "the environment is acting up."
- **Cause:** a syntax or logic break in a **PreToolUse Bash** hook runs on
  *every* Bash call, so one broken guard corrupts the whole session's tool I/O.
  (2026-07-05: a `[^;&|]` character class broke in one edit; `;&` became a bash
  `case` fallthrough token; it poisoned half a session until `bash -n` located
  it. The tell that it's a hook and not the environment: it started right after
  you touched a hook.)
- **Fix (prevention):** never register a hook that hasn't passed **`bash -n` +
  a real-JSON end-to-end run** — "my unit test passed at deploy" is insufficient
  because the file can corrupt in a *later* edit. Prefer regex that can't
  degenerate: a `.*` inside a shlex-segmented context is safe where a
  `[^;&|]` class is not.
- **Fix (detection):** a SessionStart health check that `bash -n`s every hook and
  checks symlinks (Pattern C) surfaces this class at startup instead of after
  hours of misdiagnosis.
- **Fix (escape hatch) — you cannot Bash your way out of a broken Bash guard.**
  Every repair you'd reach for (`rm` the symlink, re-`ln -s`, edit `settings.json`
  with sed) is itself a Bash call, and a corrupted PreToolUse Bash hook inspects
  those too. Routes that do **not** go through the Bash tool, cheapest first:
  1. **Edit `settings.json` with the Edit/Write tool** (file tools don't fire the
     Bash matcher) and delete the hook's entry — instant disarm, no shell needed.
  2. **Start a session with a different config home**: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<other>`
     — a profile whose settings never registered the broken hook. (Set it when
     launching the CLI, i.e. outside the poisoned session.)
  3. **Fix from outside**: any terminal not running under the agent, since the hook
     only exists on the agent's tool path, not on your shell's.
  This is also the argument for the SSOT+symlink layout: repair is one `ln -s` you
  can run from an ordinary terminal, not surgery on a live config.

---

## 4. A guard the model can bypass by itself (static env escape hatch)

- **Symptom:** the guard "exists" but the banned action still happens — the model
  set an env var to wave itself through.
- **Cause:** the release valve was a static `GUARD_OK=1` / `SCOPE_OK=1` env var.
  Anything the model can add to its own command is not a gate.
- **Fix:** a **human-confirmation gate** the model physically can't drive —
  full two-channel pattern (native dialog / typed YES, hard-NO semantics,
  audit log, testability) in
  [hook_patterns.md](hook_patterns.md#pattern-b--pretooluse-with-a-human-confirmation-release-gate)
  and the rule-of-thumb form in SKILL.md rule 4.
  (Both `WORKTREE_GUARD_OK` and `GIT_COMMIT_SCOPE_OK` were retired to this in
  2026-07.)
- **Nuance — an ack marker that's a real acknowledgement, not a free pass:** the
  subagent-scope guard accepts a `SCOPE_VERIFIED=yes` suffix, but only *after* the
  operator has gone through an AskUserQuestion authorization. The marker records
  that a human step happened; it isn't a self-serve toggle. If the marker can be
  added without any out-of-band human step, it's pitfall #4 again.

---

## 5. A guard registered in only one profile (multi-profile under-registration)

- **Symptom:** the guard works in your main profile but the mistake still happens
  in another profile (a model-switch profile, a student profile). One profile ran
  with **zero** PreToolUse guards for weeks.
- **Cause:** hooks are registered per-profile in each profile's `settings.json`.
  A hook file present in `~/.claude/hooks/` does nothing unless the *active*
  profile calls it.
- **Fix:** register in the main profile; there is no separate convergence step.
  This setup registers `sync-profile-settings.py` (owned by
  `claude-switch-models-setup`) as a SessionStart hook **without arguments**, so
  the next profile to start a session converges every profile at once —
  `--all` is only for propagating an edit immediately instead of at the next
  session start. Add the guard's name to the SessionStart health check's
  registration grep so drift is visible.

---

## 6. A dangling symlink silently disarms a Tier-0 guard

- **Symptom:** a guard that worked for months just … stops, with no error.
- **Cause:** the hook lived only in `~/.claude/hooks/`, and a `~/.claude`
  reinstall/migration wiped it — or the symlink target moved. No signal either way.
- **Fix:** keep the **SSOT in a version-controlled dir** (`~/scripts/claude-hooks/`)
  and symlink into `~/.claude/hooks/`; recovery is one `ln -s`. The SessionStart
  health check's `[ -e "$h" ]` test (which follows the link) reports a dangling
  symlink at startup.

---

## 7. Self-block while testing a live hook

- **Symptom:** you try to test a freshly-registered guard by running a command
  containing its trigger, and your **test command itself** gets blocked.
- **Cause:** the hook is already live in the session, so any Bash command you
  issue that contains the trigger token is inspected (and blocked) before it runs.
- **Fix:** put the test cases in a **script file** and run `bash test_hook.sh` —
  the outer command carries no trigger, so it isn't self-blocked (mechanism in
  SKILL.md rule 2 and the harness header comment).
- **The same trap bites your own `git commit`.** A commit message that merely
  *mentions* the trigger — e.g. a fix whose message quotes `foo|TRIGGER` as an
  example — is parsed by the live hook and blocked: the heredoc message text
  reaches the walker as if it were a command. (This skill's own qlmanage-guard
  blocked its own fix commit exactly this way.) So a real guard should **exempt
  git write segments** (`git commit` / `rebase` / `tag` / `am` / `cherry-pick`):
  a commit message legitimately contains arbitrary words, domains, and a
  `Co-Authored-By` trailer. `proxy-guard` and `git-worktree-guard` both skip these
  segments — a Bash guard that inspects command strings must do the same or it
  false-blocks your commits. (Stop-gap if the exemption isn't there yet: phrase the
  message so the trigger never lands in a command position — but add the exemption,
  don't rely on careful phrasing.)

---

## 8. `set -e` + `pipefail` silently kills a hook that promised "ALWAYS exit 0"

- **Symptom:** a PostToolUse / SessionStart hook that's supposed to never block
  reports a failure — the CLI shows only `Failed with non-blocking status code:
  No stderr output`, no error text, and the hook's own "always exit 0" contract
  is broken with **zero signal** to debug from.
- **Cause:** `set -euo pipefail` + a git (or any) **pipe** whose left side can
  fail — e.g. `git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l` in a non-repo /
  dubious-ownership / bad-`cd`-path context. pipefail propagates the left
  command's non-zero exit through the pipe, `set -e` kills the whole script, and
  the `2>/dev/null` already swallowed the stderr.
- **Fix:** every command feeding a substitution needs a `|| <fallback>` — the pipe
  included, and the `||` goes **OUTSIDE** the `$(…)`: `STAGED=$(git diff … | wc -l
  | tr -d ' ') || STAGED='?'`. Put it inside (`… | wc -l || echo '?'`) and `wc`
  still prints `0` when git fails, yielding the malformed two-line value `0\n?`.
  (2026-07-21 in git-commit-headcheck.)
  `grep -c` produces the same kind of two-line value with no pipe at all; #47
  covers it and what it does to arithmetic.
- **Alternative shape — keep `-e` and trap the contract:** `set -euo pipefail` +
  `trap 'exit 0' ERR` converts every failure to exit 0 while `-e` keeps guarding
  the plumbing (git-commit-headcheck's production form; the choice between this
  and dropping `-e` is SKILL.md's "-e or trap" bullet).
- **Why it's insidious:** it only fires in *edge* contexts (bad path, not-a-repo),
  so it passes every test in a healthy repo and breaks in the field — same class
  as #1 (stdin) and #3 (poisoning): a promise broken, hard to locate. If your hook
  does I/O that can fail on some machines, either drop `set -e` (use `set -uo
  pipefail`) or `||`-guard every such command.

---

## 9. A literal quote or backtick inside a Python comment corrupts a hook silently

- **Symptom:** you edit a multi-line Python block embedded in the hook (the
  `python3 -c "…many lines…"` form), `bash -n` passes clean, you register the
  hook — and a specific case that should block now silently allows (or a case
  that should pass now silently blocks), with no error anywhere. Unlike #3,
  there is no syntax error and no session-wide poisoning — just one wrong
  answer in one narrow code path, which makes it far easier to miss.
- **Cause:** the whole embedded Python source is one long bash **double-quoted
  string**. Bash's parser scans that string for its own terminator (`"`) and
  for `` ` `` (legacy command substitution) and unescaped `$` — it has no
  concept of a Python `#` comment, so a literal `"` or `` ` `` typed inside
  what you intend as a harmless Python comment still ends or splices the
  outer bash string right there. The result can easily still be
  *syntactically valid* bash (the stray quote happens to pair up with another
  nearby one, just scoping a differently-shaped string than you meant) — so
  `bash -n` finds nothing wrong, and only a real end-to-end test that exercises
  the exact affected code path reveals the corruption.
  (2026-07-21, `group-name-guard.sh`: while fixing one bug, a Chinese-language
  comment explaining the fix used a literal `"` to quote an example — inside
  the very block whose job was catching literal-quote citations — and the
  regex logic after it silently stopped matching. `bash -n` passed both times
  this happened; only re-running the real JSON test suite caught it.)
- **Fix — structural (preferred):** don't use `python3 -c "…multi-line…"` at
  all for anything with room for a comment. Use a **quoted heredoc**
  (`python3 - <<'PY'` — note the quotes around `PY`) instead, passing input
  via an env var. A quoted delimiter makes the entire body inert literal text
  to bash: no quote-parsing, no `` ` `` substitution, no `$` expansion — the
  bug class becomes impossible, not just less likely. See the heredoc note in
  [hook_patterns.md](hook_patterns.md#json-event-contract) and
  [Pattern E](hook_patterns.md#pattern-e--stop-hook-react-to-claudes-own-output)
  for the full working shape.
- **Fix — if you're stuck with `-c "…"`:** every literal `"` and `` ` `` in
  the embedded source — code AND comments — must be backslash-escaped
  (`\"`, `` \` ``); for CJK prose comments, prefer corner brackets `「」` or
  book-title marks `《》` over straight quotes — they read naturally in
  Chinese and aren't bash-special, so there's nothing to remember to escape.
  Before registering, audit the embedded span directly rather than trusting a
  visual read: `awk 'NR==<start>,NR==<end>' hook.sh | grep -n '"\|`'` (and
  `grep -nF '$'` for stray dollar signs) — a clean grep on the exact span is
  stronger evidence than "I re-read it and it looked fine," which is
  precisely the check that failed twice in the incident above.

## 10. A path parsed from command text keeps its literal `~` — guard fails **open**

**Symptom.** The guard never fires for commands that `cd` somewhere first. No error,
no log line, no misbehavior you can see — it just silently allows. In the case that
surfaced it, two sibling hooks shared one parsing helper and degraded *differently*:
a PostToolUse context-injector kept emitting its own fallback string
(`"cannot read HEAD — not a git repo or bad path"`) for weeks, which everyone read as
"that hook is noisy again"; the PreToolUse scope guard beside it gave **no signal at
all** — it simply stopped guarding. Same root cause, one visible-but-dismissed
symptom and one invisible.

**Cause.** Tilde expansion is done by the **shell**, before a command ever runs. A
hook that determines its target by *parsing the command text* (`cd X && git commit`,
`git -C X commit`) never goes through a shell, so it receives the literal string
`~/repo`. Then:

```bash
git -C "~/repo" log -1        # fatal: cannot change to '~/repo': No such file or directory
git -C "~/repo" diff --cached --name-only   # → empty, exit non-zero, swallowed by 2>/dev/null
```

The headcheck degraded to a visible-but-ignorable message. The scope guard did
something worse: empty staged list → "zero files, so zero cross-domain files" →
**allow**. Rule 5's failure direction, in the wild.

**Fix.** Expand in the parser, once, at the shared source. (The helper here is a `.sh` file whose parsing core is an embedded `python3` block — Pattern A's shape — so the fix is Python even though the file is shell:)

```python
repo_dir = os.path.expanduser(repo_dir) if repo_dir else repo_dir
```

`expanduser` is the identity function for anything not starting with `~`, and
`expanduser('') == ''` — so the `if repo_dir else` guard above is belt-and-braces, not
required; `repo_dir = os.path.expanduser(repo_dir)` alone is correct. Keep whichever
reads better in your parser; the load-bearing part is that the expansion happens
**inside the parser**, so every caller inherits it.

**The shared-library twist — this is the part that bites twice.** The parser was a
common helper (`lib-git-commit-detect.sh`) used by three hooks. Fixing it fixed all
three at once, which is why the SSOT structure is right — but it also means
**"I verified the fix" must mean "I verified every caller."** In the real incident
the author fixed the library, verified two callers (a commit-form guard and the PostToolUse context-injector),
declared it done — and the *third* caller, the scope guard, went unverified. It was
both the one that fails open and the only one of the three that actually blocks. It
took the user asking "so did you fix it?" for the gap to surface. When you patch a
shared helper, enumerate its callers (`grep -l '<lib-name>' *.sh`) and put every one
of them in the test table.

**Generalization (not git-specific).** Any hook that reconstructs state by *reading
the command instead of running it* inherits the whole class: `~` unexpanded, `$VARS`
uninterpolated, `$(cmd)` unexecuted, globs unmatched, relative paths resolved against
the wrong cwd. If your hook takes a path out of command text and hands it to a real
command, expand what the shell would have expanded — or decide, per rule 5, that an
unresolvable path means **block**.

  **The same parser has a second, sharper failure once you give it a fallback:**
  it then answers confidently about the wrong repository instead of failing open.
  Fixing #10 does not fix that — see #28. Note also that the shared-library
  reassurance above has a boundary: it protects the hooks that *source* the
  helper. A hook carrying its own inline parser inherits none of the fix and
  has to be patched separately (that is exactly how #28 survived #10).

## 11. Newline-blind segmentation misses the multiline command (fixtures pass, real corpus barely fires)

- **Symptom:** the hook passes every synthetic fixture (`git push origin main`,
  `cd x && git push`) yet fires far less than expected on real transcripts — in one
  incident its replayed trigger rate was **0** where the targeted population should
  have shown ~5%.
- **Cause:** the git operations this kind of guard targets are usually written as
  *multiline* blocks — `cd /repo\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m x\ngit push`. A
  segmenter built on `shlex.shlex(..., whitespace_split=True)` — the very tokenizer
  #2 recommends for quoting-safety — treats the **newline as ordinary whitespace and
  drops it**, so the lines collapse into ONE token stream with no separator token,
  yielding a single segment whose head is `cd`. The `git push` further down is no
  longer at a segment head, and the command-position check (#2) never sees it.
  Single-line fixtures cannot expose this: they have no newline to swallow.
- **Fix — two stages, and the order matters.** First split into lines with the
  **shell-aware** splitter `split_shell_lines` (walker section / Pattern A), which
  tracks quote state, backslash continuations and `$'…'` escapes. Then, *within each
  line*, use #2's `shlex` tokenizer
  to segment on `;`/`&&`/`|` and walk for command position. This defeats the common
  #2 trap: a `|` inside `grep -E "a|git push|b"`, or an `&&` inside a *single-line*
  `git commit -m "… && git push"`, stays inside one `shlex` token, so no phantom
  `git push` segment is manufactured. Do **not** instead do the whole job with one
  quote-blind split like `re.split(r"[\n;]|&&|\|\||[|&]", cmd)`: that cuts those same
  separators *inside* quotes — pitfall #2, the worst bug in this file — and orphans
  the inner text from its `git commit` head, defeating #7's exemption.
- **Name its residual, don't hide it — and know which stage-1 you are naming.** The
  first form of this fix split lines as plain text (`cmd.split("\n")`). That form is
  **superseded**: being quote-blind about newlines, it fragments a newline **inside**
  a quoted string and false-blocks a healthy command — measured on this file's own
  harness row `quoted-multiline` (`echo "line1\nTRIGGER…\nline3"`, want 0, got 2),
  which is the error direction #2 ranks as the worse one. Do not copy it.
  **2026-07-26 refinement (production qlmanage-guard, three review rounds with
  100+ executed probes), now the prescription above:** `split_shell_lines`
  (walker section / Pattern A) tracks quote state, backslash continuations, and
  `$'…'` ANSI-C escapes, which removes the *quoted-string* half of the residual
  (the `gh pr create -b "…\nTRIGGER…"` shape — more common than heredocs in real
  tool calls). **What remains is heredoc bodies only**: they are not quote syntax,
  so no quote-state machine can see them. The clean witness for that surviving
  residual is `git commit -F - <<'MSG'` whose body contains a bare `git push` line —
  it splits off and reads as a command it isn't.
  Whether that residual is acceptable follows the same **bias-to-under** call as #2:
  for a **fail-open reminder** an extra over-fire costs nothing — declare it and move
  on; for a **fail-closed blocker** it re-creates #2's false-block, so you must lift
  #7's `git commit`/heredoc exemption to the **whole-command** level *before*
  splitting, or parse with a real shell grammar.
- **Why you only catch it with real data:** this is the `合成 fixture 全绿 ≠ 正确`
  trap — the fixtures you invent share the blind spot that wrote the bug (you think
  in one-liners; production is multiline). So replay the hook over a **real corpus**
  before shipping. And when a replay returns "0 / clean", treat the **harness
  itself** as a suspect too: a random-sample replay can read 0 purely because the
  sample was diluted (measure the *population that can possibly fire*, not a uniform
  sample), and a mutation test can report "survived" because the mutation never
  applied. Both are the same failure as the hook's own — the instrument lying in the
  safe-looking direction. Confirm the harness can report "dirty" on an input you have
  *independently proven* should fire, before you believe any "clean".

---

## 12. The decision reads the string built for humans — and that string is lossy

- **Symptom:** a conditional branch inside the hook works in every test and
  silently stops firing in production. Nothing errors; the branch just never
  matches, so a whole paragraph of guidance (or a whole check) disappears for
  exactly the sessions that needed it most.
- **Cause:** the hook computed a **display string** first — sorted, joined,
  truncated to the first N with a `(+M more)` tail — and then pattern-matched
  its own decision against that string. Truncation is lossy by design, so any
  item past the cutoff is invisible to the branch. The tests never showed it
  because a fixture has two or three items and a real session has ten.
  Real case (2026-07-23): a Stop hook reported `path [kind], path [kind], … (+N
  more)` and then did `case "$REPORT" in *"[skill]"*)`. A session that touched six
  artifacts with the skill sorting sixth dropped the `[skill]` tag out of the
  rendered list, and the skill-specific guidance vanished — in a hook whose entire
  target population is large multi-artifact sessions.
- **Fix:** emit the machine-readable fact on its own channel, never re-derive it
  from the rendering. One extra line is enough — a `KINDS:a,b,c` header line that
  is never truncated, with the human list below it, and the branch matches the
  header. General form: **a rendering is an output, not a data source.** If you
  find yourself grepping something your own code formatted for a reader, you have
  a second, undeclared parser of your own display format — and it will drift the
  moment you change how things look.
- **Test that pins it:** a fixture with **more items than the display cutoff**,
  where the item the branch cares about sorts *after* the cutoff. Without that
  row the bug is invisible; with it, reverting to the display-string match fails
  loudly.

---

## 13. Classification keyed on a naming convention the real layout doesn't follow

- **Symptom:** a whole category of input is never detected. Not misdetected —
  *absent*. The hook reports nothing for it, which is indistinguishable from
  "there was nothing to report."
- **Cause:** the classifier matched a path shape (`/skills?/[^/]+/(references|scripts|assets)/`)
  that encodes one directory convention. Real repositories use others. Real case:
  a marketplace repo lays skills out as `claude-code-skills/<suite>/<skill>/references/…`
  — not one path segment equals `skills`, so every edit to a skill's reference or
  script files was classified `None`. The pattern had been in the table for
  months, tested only against `~/.claude/skills/<name>/…`, which does match.
- **Fix — do NOT just widen the regex.** Widening to `/[^/]+/(references|scripts|assets)/`
  makes every repository on the machine with a `scripts/` directory match, trading a
  silent miss for pervasive false positives — the trade rule 1 explicitly forbids
  (误杀健康输入比漏报更糟). Key the decision on a **verifiable fact** instead: *is
  there a `SKILL.md` next to this `references/` directory?* One `os.path.exists`
  against the filesystem is layout-independent, cannot fire on an unrelated
  project, and stays correct when someone invents a new directory convention
  tomorrow. Wrap it so an `OSError` falls to the safe direction (rule 5).
- **When the candidate IS the anchor.** The question above is "is there a
  `SKILL.md` beside this `references/` directory", which has no answer for a path
  that *is* `…/myskill/SKILL.md`. Classify that one by basename — and note why
  that is not the naming-habit trap this entry warns about: `SKILL.md` is a name
  the platform's spec defines and the loader actually keys on, whereas
  `/skills?/` was a habit of one directory layout. The test is whether something
  outside your head enforces the name.
- **The general rule:** when a hook classifies a resource, prefer a check the
  world can answer (does this file exist, what does the API return, what is the
  actual git ref) over a check that only your naming habit can answer. Conventions
  are per-repo and per-era; facts are not. Reach for a name pattern only when
  there is no fact to query — and then say so in a comment, so the next reader
  knows it is a heuristic standing in for evidence.

---

## 14. The self-test asserts exit codes — but this hook's product is its text

- **Symptom:** the suite is green, the hook exits with the right codes on every
  row, and the message it prints is wrong, missing a paragraph, or emitting a
  section that should have been conditional. Nobody notices until a human reads
  the output.
- **Cause:** for a **blocking** hook the exit code *is* most of the contract, so
  exit-code assertions cover it. But a hook whose real product is the **stderr
  guidance** — a PreToolUse message explaining the correct alternative, a Stop
  reminder telling the model what to do next — has a second output channel that
  exit codes cannot see. Break the message body, invert the condition on an
  optional paragraph, let a heredoc swallow a section: the exit code stays
  exactly 2, and every row still passes. The suite is structurally blind to the
  only thing that hook produces.
- **Fix:** add content assertions alongside the exit-code rows, with the `says`
  helper shipped in [scripts/test_hook.sh](../scripts/test_hook.sh) — its header
  comment carries the full doctrine (both polarities across two fixtures,
  fixed-string matching because a BRE `[skill]` is a character class, and the
  mutation pass that proves each row can die), which SKILL.md's harness section
  repeats at rule length. Use the shipped helper rather than re-typing one — a
  copy in prose drifts from the one people actually run (this entry shipped with
  a copy that had no pass/fail counters, so a failing content row printed FAIL
  and the suite still ended "ALL PASS").
- **Then prove the assertions are not vacuous — mutate and confirm they die.**
  Copy the hook, inject the specific bug each assertion claims
  to catch (invert the branch condition, delete the fact-check, revert to the
  display-string match), and confirm *that* assertion goes red — and ideally only
  that one. Real case: four separate mutations each killed exactly their intended
  row; the same suite had previously been green while two real bugs (#12, #13)
  were live in the file, because no row looked at the text.

---

## 15. Command text that merely *contains* a write, treated as a write

- **Symptom:** a forensic hook (one that scans a transcript or command history to
  decide what a session touched) reports a file nobody wrote — sometimes a path
  that is obviously not a path, like `$AD/SKILL.md`.
- **Cause:** the hook extracts write targets from **command text**, and command
  text routinely carries *data that looks like commands*: a heredoc body being
  written into another file, a fixture string inside a `python3 -` script, a
  snippet of shell being embedded in documentation. The redirect it "found" was
  never executed in this process — it was cargo.
- **Cheap filter, and be honest that it under-reports.** Dropping any candidate
  path that still contains an unexpanded variable or a backtick —
  ``re.compile(r"[$\x60]")`` against the candidate — kills the common cargo case
  in one line. But **do not tell yourself this has no false negatives.** Command
  text is *pre-expansion* (that is #10's whole thesis), so a genuine
  `cat > "$OUT/file"` with `$OUT` set writes a real file whose path arrives with
  the `$` still in it — this filter drops that too. You are trading *missing some
  real writes* for *not inventing fake ones*, which is the right trade for a
  **fail-open reporter** and the wrong one for anything that blocks. Say which you
  are in a comment next to the filter.
- **The same class has a sibling this filter does not cover:** a literal `~`
  survives it, then silently fails whatever you do with the path afterwards —
  `cat > ~/skills/x/references/a.md` passes the `$` filter and then makes an
  `os.path.exists` check (#13) return False for a file that plainly exists. Run
  `os.path.expanduser` before any filesystem check, exactly as #10 requires.
- **The deeper case has no cheap fix, and #11 does not solve it either.** A
  fully-literal path inside a heredoc body needs real heredoc boundary tracking;
  #11 lists that same residual as *unsolved* on its own axis and points at "parse
  with a real shell grammar". So for a blocking hook the over-report is a false
  block and you owe it that parse; for a reporter, accept the noise and say so.
- **Why it matters beyond noise:** a false entry does not just add a line. If
  the hook branches on *kind* (#12), one phantom path of the wrong kind switches
  on guidance the session never needed — the reader is handed a procedure for
  work they did not do, which is exactly the "误杀" that trains people to stop
  reading the hook's output.

## 16. The remediation the hook demands re-arms the hook (a loop with no variant)

- **Symptom:** a Stop hook fires, the model does exactly what it asked, the hook
  fires again on the same grounds. Repeat until a human interrupts. No error, no
  crash, green self-test, and `stop_hook_active` **is** handled correctly.
- **Cause:** the hook's condition is a **temporal comparison** whose operand is
  moved by the very remediation it demands. Canonical **fire** condition:
  `last_offending_action > last_remediation`. Remediation that is worth doing
  produces work — findings get adopted, files get edited — so
  `last_offending_action` jumps back ahead and the condition re-arms.
  (Watch the orientation: what you naturally *write* is the **pass** condition —
  "the review must be newer than the last edit". T is its negation. State T as
  the fire condition or you will reason about the wrong operand.) The loop has
  no [variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant): nothing strictly
  decreases per cycle, so nothing forces termination.
- **Why `stop_hook_active` doesn't cover it.** It means "the stop I just blocked
  is being retried" — one layer of re-entry inside one stop attempt. This loop is
  *cross-turn* (real work, then a fresh Stop with the field `false`). Handling it
  is necessary and buys nothing here. Full contract: SKILL.md rule 7. **Nor does
  the harness's consecutive-block ceiling cover it** — that counter resets on any
  continuation that executed tools, and remediation worth demanding is made of
  tool calls, so it stays pinned at 1 (#27). Both runtime protections are blind
  to exactly this loop; the bound has to be yours.
- **Fix — change the shape of the predicate, not its threshold.** In order:
  (a) if what you're gating is an **action**, move the gate onto that action with
  PreToolUse instead of onto the turn with Stop — one evaluation per attempt, no
  cross-turn re-fire; (b) else test an **existence fact keyed on the thing that
  needed remediating** (`V = 1 - exists` per key — a global key kills the hook
  forever, a time-based key is the temporal predicate again); (c) else a
  per-session **repetition ceiling** (`V = N - fired`), crude but finite. Cool-down
  windows (hysteresis) fix a *different* problem — a condition oscillating around
  a threshold — not one that remediation **resets**. Runnable snippets and the
  design-time `# TERMINATION:` convention: SKILL.md rule 7.
- **The self-test row pair that can see it.** Same event, receipt absent → fires;
  receipt present → quiet, with `rm -f` / `: >` around them (the state lives on the
  filesystem, so a plain `run` row cannot express it). Template in
  [../scripts/test_hook.sh](../scripts/test_hook.sh), "AFTER-REMEDIATION ROWS". If
  the second row also fires, the predicate is temporal — fix the predicate, not
  the fixture.

---

## 17. A Stop guard that reports only the first violation loses the rest (the retry round is a full pass-through)
- **Symptom:** a Stop hook correctly blocks on finding X in the model's reply;
  the model fixes X and stops again — and the reply still contains violation Y
  from the same original turn, never reported, never caught.
- **Cause:** the hook printed the first finding and stopped looking. The retry
  round arrives with `stop_hook_active: true`, which the hook (correctly)
  honors by letting the turn end — so everything it did not say in round one
  sails through permanently. The anti-loop field that saves you from infinite
  re-entry is precisely what makes the first block your only informed bite.
  (The harness's consecutive-block ceiling does not rescue you either: banking
  on "I'll catch it next round" burns it when the remediation is reply-only,
  and never reaches it at all when the remediation involves tool calls — #27.)
- **Fix:** collect *all* findings before printing (cap the list — five is
  plenty — so a pathological reply can't flood the model's context), and write
  the message as an escape manual: each finding plus the exact acceptable fix.
  Test it: a two-violations fixture must exit 2 with BOTH in stderr — a suite
  that only ever feeds one violation per case structurally cannot see this.
- **Real case (2026-07-25):** a group-name guard reported only the first
  coined shorthand in a reply that coined two; the honored retry round fixed
  the first and ended the turn with the second intact. Found by an independent
  reviewer, fixed by collecting all matches (cap 5); regression row
  "多命中一次报全" pins it.

---

## 18. A blocked compound command silently discards the innocent segments' side effects

- **Symptom:** you fixed something and ran the gated command in the SAME Bash
  call (`fix_thing && gated_command`); the guard blocked it; next round the
  SAME error reappears — as if your fix never happened. You re-diagnose,
  "discover" the fix is missing, and only then realize why.
- **Cause:** a PreToolUse block prevents the **whole** command from running —
  including innocent segments (a heredoc updating a file, a map write, an edit)
  chained before or after the gated one. The block error names the gated
  segment, so all attention goes there; the innocent write's silent absence
  leaves no signal of its own.
- **Fix — two habits, one on each side of the block:** when *building*
  commands, put state-changing steps (file writes, edits, map updates) in their
  **own** Bash call, never bundled with a command a guard might block; when
  *recovering* from a block, re-verify every write you *assumed* had landed
  before the block (`grep` for the change) — "the error named the other
  segment" is exactly the situation where your side effect is gone. Real case
  (2026-07-25, twice in one session): a needle-fix heredoc bundled with the
  validation command; the tooling guard blocked the bundle; the validator
  re-reported byte-identical errors because the fix never landed — diagnosed
  only on the second identical failure.

---

## 19. A block whose remediation demands cross-call memory re-fires all session

- **Symptom:** the hook blocks, its message teaches the correct form, you
  comply — and get blocked again for the same reason. And again. (One session
  measured **10** blocks for the identical cause, plus 3 sibling failures —
  including a feature branch created in the *wrong repository*.)
- **Cause:** the remediation the hook demands is a **habit change that must be
  remembered across tool calls** — e.g. "always prefix this command family with
  `cd <tool-root>`" — and three things conspire against that memory, none of
  which is carelessness: **attention resets per call** (the model re-reads the
  lesson and re-forgets it each time, because at the moment of action the goal
  is the task, not the form); **shell state does not persist** (env vars and
  functions are re-initialized from the profile each call — so a remediation
  that relies on an exported variable dies with the call; only settings.json's
  `env` block or the shell profile makes one stick); and **environment drift in
  `cd` behavior** — the documented contract is that the working directory
  *does* persist between calls, yet harnesses/profiles deviate in practice, and
  a `cd` that *does* stick creates its own failure mode (the next command then
  runs in the wrong repo entirely — the sibling failure in the incident below:
  a feature branch created in the wrong repository, which could only happen
  *because* the directory persisted). The hook is correct every time, and it
  does not matter: the remediation's success depends on memory surviving
  boundaries it often doesn't survive, so the block re-fires until the session
  ends or the environment changes. (2026-07-25, one session: **10** identical
  blocks + those 3 sibling failures.)
- **Fix — pick the guard's answer deliberately, knowing the class:** (a) put
  the corrective *in the environment* instead of the message (a wrapper script
  that doesn't care about cwd, a `PYTHONPATH` or variable set in settings.json's
  `env` block or the shell profile — an ad-hoc exported var dies with the call,
  per the Cause above) so the habit is no longer required — strongest, because
  it removes the dependency; (b) convert the block to a fail-open reminder for
  habit-class rules (a noisy PreToolUse block trains bypass exactly as #2
  warns); (c) accept and *measure* the repetition as the cost of enforcement —
  10 blocks can mean "guard working, loudly", but then say so in the header so
  nobody "fixes" it. What does not work: making the block message clearer. It
  was clear every one of the 10 times.

## 20. Agent deliveries counted as turn boundaries truncate the detection window

- **Symptom:** a turn-scoped transcript hook (one that judges "did X happen
  THIS turn") goes **quiet** even though unremediated work is sitting right
  there — or its review-tracking never registers completed reviews. Nothing
  errors; the reports just stop matching reality.
- **Cause:** agent deliveries (teammate messages / completion receipts) arrive
  as `type: "user"` records in the transcript. A turn-boundary rule that treats
  every user message as a new turn lets **every delivery start a new "turn"** —
  work done *before* the delivery falls outside the window. Real audit
  (2026-07-26): the last turn-start in a long session sat 6 lines from the
  transcript tail — the entire audit's edits and pushes were outside the window,
  so a compounding-artifact hook reported nothing. The twin blind spot in the
  same incident: the review channel itself was built on one schema
  (`agentId: <hex>` in tool_results) while the environment used another
  (`agent_id: <name>@session-<uuid>` + `teammate_id` deliveries), so no review
  ever registered either — false quiet and false fire coexisting in one hook.
- **Fix:** treat deliveries as events *inside* the turn, not as boundaries.
  Exclude them by wrapper form — content starting `"Another Claude session sent
  a message:"` / `<teammate-message` — in **both** content branches (string and
  list), and audit every other system record the same way (isMeta injections,
  interrupt receipts — compounding-edit-review's `is_turn_start` is the working
  example; its selftest ⑰ pins "teammate must not truncate the window"). And
  validate the *channel* per environment: parse a real transcript from every
  profile/mode you run in — fixture-testing a single schema is how the twin
  blind spot shipped (rule 7's observability form, SKILL.md).

---

## 21. Prefix-based resolution must anchor on a typed tail

- **Symptom:** the hook resolves an entity by glob/prefix (a file, a name, a
  token family) and silently picks the WRONG one — a verdict meant for agent A
  lands on agent B, and the decision is inverted: a delegated write-and-push
  gets the "independent review" stamp, or a genuine review reads as delegation.
  Nothing looks wrong because each file in isolation is valid.
- **Cause:** prefix matching ignores that names are **prefixes of other names**.
  Real case (2026-07-26, reproduced both directions): a review-detection hook
  resolved agent transcripts with `agent-a<name>-*.jsonl` — the agent pair
  `r4-final-reviewer` and `r4-final-reviewer-2` (which really coexisted in the
  session) both matched, and "newest by mtime" made the review read the wrong
  agent's file. Sibling shapes in the same audit: a bundle-arity blind spot
  (`-mn` = `-m n`, not `-n`), a flag-family table (`-am"msg"` attached value),
  and a trailing-separator reset (a state machine whose `first` slot is
  re-zeroed by a trailing `;` or comment line, losing the last real segment).
- **Fix — anchor the typed tail, never the bare prefix:** for filenames,
  require the delimiter + a typed suffix (`agent-a<name>-[0-9a-f]{8,}.jsonl`,
  not `agent-a<name>-*`); for flag families, enumerate the family (`-aXXX`
  bundled counts as `-a`) AND model arity (after a valued flag, the next thing
  is data); for segment state machines, keep the last NON-EMPTY segment's head
  (`last_first`), never the current slot after a trailing separator. Then pin
  the colliding pair in a fixture — a singleton passing proves nothing about
  resolution (compounding-edit-review's selftest grew exactly these).

---

## 22. A hook fleet on every tool call is a fork multiplier — the irrelevant path must cost zero forks

- **Symptom:** the machine runs hot and the battery drops fast under several
  parallel agent sessions; a spawn-rate recorder shows a sustained 40–177
  forks/sec (peak, scaling with session count and agent activity) all day,
  and `syspolicyd` (Gatekeeper) tops the all-day CPU-integrated ranking with
  NO single runaway process. Nothing is "broken" —
  every process has a legitimate owner. Treating this as "normal because it's
  owned" is the mistake: an unthrottled loop and a runaway are structurally
  identical to the system underneath.
- **Cause:** each PreToolUse Bash hook that opens with `INPUT=$(cat)` plus one
  or more `printf … | python3 -c …` parses costs 2–3 forks **even when the
  command is irrelevant to that guard**. With ~13 hooks on the Bash matcher ×
  several parallel agent sessions × sub-second tool-call cadence, that alone
  is 40–200 forks/sec of pure guard overhead, and every `exec` also bills
  `syspolicyd` a Gatekeeper evaluation — which is how a distributed,
  by-design load lands on one system daemon's CPU total. The fleet is fine;
  the per-call cost of the *irrelevant* path is the bug.
- **Fix — the 0-fork fast path, with semantics preserved per guard type:**
  1. Replace `INPUT=$(cat)` with the builtin `IFS= read -rd '' INPUT || true`
     (stdin can only be read once — hand the captured var to the existing
     code, do not leave a later `$(cat)` to read EOF).
  2. Coarse-filter with a **builtin** `case`/`[[ == ]]` on the raw JSON and
     `exit 0` before paying for python3/jq. The filter must be *broader* than
     the hook's decision domain and **never flag-level**: shell normalization
     (`--no-\verify`, `-n` short forms, `VAR=val` prefixes) produces real
     flags that byte-matching cannot see — filter only on "is this command
     even about X" (e.g. `*git*`; `*openrouter*|*claude.ai*` for a domain
     guard). Case-handling: **never narrower in case than the real check** —
     a case-sensitive coarse filter feeding a case-insensitive real check
     silently under-blocks; broader case (e.g. `nocasematch`, or glob bracket
     classes on bash 3.2) is always safe, it only costs a fall-through.
  3. **Fail-closed guards need a legitimate-payload gate — and a marker
     substring alone is NOT enough.** A bare coarse filter exits 0 on
     malformed input the original fail-closed parse layer would have blocked
     — measured: `'not json'` sailed through the first cut of this fix and
     the guard's contract silently changed from block-unknown to
     allow-unknown. But a `*tool_name*` substring gate re-opens the same
     hole from the other side: `echo 'tool_name'` (marker present, not
     parseable, no keyword) ALSO exits 0 where the original blocked
     (independent review, reproduced). The gate that actually closed it
     requires BOTH: the `*tool_name*` marker AND a payload that — after
     trimming trailing whitespace — ends in `}`. The `}` rule is not
     cosmetic: `read -d ''` stops at the first NUL, so a truncated payload
     like `{"tool_name":"Bash",` carries the marker but no keyword and must
     NOT be trusted (measured: old=2 → new=0 without it). Documented
     residue, disclosed not fixed: a malformed payload that still ends in
     `}` (`{"tool_name": invalid}`) passes the gate — it is a heuristic,
     not a validity proof, and the harness never emits one.
  3b. **Disclose the raw-byte blind spot in EVERY blocking guard's comment,
     not just one.** A JSON `\uXXXX`-escaped keyword defeats any raw-byte
     filter — reproduced end-to-end: a fully-escaped `git commit -am`,
     `git reset --hard`, or proxied domain exits 0 through the fast path
     where the original layer decoded and blocked (construct the payload
     with octal `printf '\134'` or a generator that never decodes — two of
     three first attempts accidentally produced literal text and a false
     negative). The harness JSON encoder never escapes ASCII letters, so
     accept the risk — but write the acceptance into **every** blocking
     guard's fast-path comment: fail-closed guards, AND parse-fail-open /
     verdict-blocking hybrids (a form/bypass/proxy guard exits 0 on
     unparseable input yet exit 2 on a matched verdict — the blind spot
     hits their verdict layer, direction block→allow). Pure informational
     hooks (always-exit-0 by contract) are exempt: both paths allow anyway.
  4. Verify per hook with the six-case suite — irrelevant / blocking /
     allowed / empty / malformed / keyword-present-but-irrelevant — plus a
     `python3`-stubbed `PATH` for fail-closed guards (their contract is
     exit 2 exactly there) and the three malformed-marker forms from step 3
     (`echo 'tool_name'`, `["tool_name"]`, NUL-truncated payload). Measure
     the floor: `bash` startup + builtin
     `case` ≈ 6.6 ms/call; the guards that used to cost 45–57 ms per
     irrelevant call now cost ~6 (independently re-measured at 4.7 ms on
     the heaviest one), and that is the entire win — the
     blocking path is intentionally unchanged.
- **Consolidate compatible mechanisms:** use in-process rule modules with shared
  input parsing and lazy queries; preserve each module's SSOT, tests, selectors,
  state and authorization evidence. Keep failure identities observable and
  calibrate parse/import failures so one broken module cannot silently disable
  the other rules. Follow the Skill's Build order for protocol and wait-budget
  boundaries. Launching the old scripts behind one dispatcher hides the fleet
  without removing its process cost; measure child processes as well as native
  handler count.

---

## 23. A "skip the next token" table that no one checked against the real tool's arity swallows the banned flag as "data"

- **Symptom:** a blocking guard keeps a table of "flags whose next token is a
  value, not a flag" (to avoid false positives on `-m "-a"`-style data). One
  day a probe shows the banned form sailing through: `git commit -e -a`
  exits 0, `git commit -e --no-verify` exits 0 through **two independent
  guards at once** — the PII-defense line is pierced while every table entry
  "looks right" and every fixture passes.
- **Cause:** a **boolean** flag was sitting in the valued-flag table, so the
  scanner skipped the token AFTER it — and that token was the banned flag
  itself. Real case (2026-07-26, R7终审 with scratch-repo ground truth):
  git's `-e` is boolean `--edit` (takes NO value — `git commit -e --no-verify
  --dry-run` parses both flags independently), yet `-e` was in THREE tables
  across two files: a form guard's skip set, a bypass guard's DATA_FLAGS, and
  a bundle-arity character set (`-en` read as "e's value is n" — actually
  `-e -n`). The tables were each written by reasoning from flag *names*, not
  by checking arity; the same wrong assumption in two files means
  cross-reviewing one file against the other finds agreement, not truth.
- **Fix — every skip-table entry must trace to the tool's real arity, not
  the flag's vibe:** (1) verify with ground truth (scratch repo / `--help` /
  parsing experiment) — for git commit the valued short flags are `m F C c t
  G` and `-u` with its ATTACHED optional value (`-uall` = `--untracked-files
  =all`, so `u` also absorbs the rest of a bundle); (2) model bundles by
  walking characters left to right and STOPPING at the first valued char —
  `-ma` is message "a" (allow), `-eam` hits `a` before `m` (block), the old
  `startswith("-a")` catches `-am"x"` but misses `-ea`; (3) when the same
  table exists in two guards, fix both in one commit and write the ground-
  truth command into each comment, or the next editor re-derives the error
  from the sibling file.

---

## 24. Every character in a boundary regex's negated class is a blind-spot decision — derive it from the entity's syntax

- **Symptom:** after a "fix the boundary" patch, the guard now blocks the
  impostor (`notclaude.ai`) correctly — but a probe finds the REAL thing
  (`api.claude.ai`, the actual API endpoint a Tier-0 rule exists to cover)
  exiting 0. The fixture list (block impostor ✓, allow bare domain ✓) is
  all green; the regression is invisible because nobody probed the legal
  subdomain.
- **Cause:** the lookbehind `(?<![A-Za-z0-9.-])` added `.` to the negated
  class. A dot before the domain means "subdomain of the SAME zone" —
  exactly what the rule covers (`*.claude.ai`) — and the patch excluded it.
  Each character in that class is a claim about what may precede the needle
  while still being the same entity; adding one silently re-scopes the rule.
  Real case (2026-07-26): this was itself a regression introduced while
  fixing a different boundary complaint — the old substring matcher blocked
  subdomains fine, the "improved" boundary traded one hole for a worse one.
- **Fix — derive the class from the entity's grammar, and probe all three
  cells:** for DNS, a label is `[A-Za-z0-9-]` and `.` is the hierarchy
  separator, so the boundary is exactly `(?<![A-Za-z0-9-])`. Then probe the
  full truth table: impostor-prefixed (`notclaude.ai` → allow), legal
  subdomain (`api.claude.ai` → block), suffix-impostor (`claude.ai.evil.com`
  → block), bare (`claude.ai` → block). A boundary patch that only re-runs
  the fixtures it was written for will green-light its own regression.
  Sibling shape: `startswith("core.hookspath")` key matching eats
  `core.hooksPathValue` — the same "boundary not derived from the entity"
  mistake in plain-string form; match the key exactly.

---

## 25. Blocking a "write" without modeling the tool's read forms blocks the guard's own health check

- **Symptom:** a guard that must stop *persistent* config tampering blocks
  `git config core.hooksPath` — a READ-only query — so the operator (or the
  agent) cannot inspect the very configuration the guard exists to protect.
  The failure direction is the worst one: healthy input killed, reflexive
  bypass trained. Meanwhile `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 make test` — no git anywhere
  in the segment — is also blocked, because the env-injection scan fires
  before anyone checked the segment even runs git.
- **Cause:** mode detection recognized only explicit read flags
  (`--get/--list/-l`), but git's most natural read form is `git config
  <key>` with NO value argument (1 arg = query, ≥2 args = write) — a form
  the flag-list model classifies as "set". And the env-injection detector
  returned its hit the moment it saw a dangerous VAR=val, before the
  git-entry check two sections later; the layers were ordered by where the
  code was added, not by "is this segment even the tool I guard".
  Both found 2026-07-26 by r7 review probes against real git semantics.
- **Fix — model the tool's read/write grammar, and gate side detectors on
  target presence:** (1) enumerate the read forms from the tool's actual
  semantics (`config <key>` no-value = query, `--get-all/--get-regexp/
  --get-urlmatch` are reads too; skip valued flags like `--file` when
  counting args), then classify writes as "≥2 non-flag args or an `--unset`
  family flag"; (2) a side-channel detector (env injection, wrapper smuggle)
  must NOTE its hit and only return it after confirming the segment's
  effective command is the guarded tool — `VAR=x make test` is not your
  jurisdiction; (3) add the tool's own health-check command
  (`git config core.hooksPath`) to the allow fixtures — if the guard blocks
  the command you'd run to debug it, the table is wrong by construction.

---

## 26. A hook that activates mid-session only guards what happens AFTER it — work from before stays unexamined unless something else checks

- **Symptom:** a hook ships mid-session specifically because a systemic
  anti-pattern was just caught, and it works exactly as designed — every
  later attempt at the pattern gets blocked. It is tempting to treat the
  problem as closed for the whole session. It isn't: anything already
  running, already dispatched, or already reported before the hook existed
  sat outside anything the hook could ever have inspected.
- **Why this belongs in a "bug that shipped" catalog when the hook itself
  didn't misbehave:** every other entry here is a broken guard; this one is
  a correctly-working guard paired with a wrong assumption about what it
  covers. It earns a slot anyway because it's exactly the mistake a hook
  author makes in the minutes right after shipping a fix — "I closed this"
  instead of "I closed this going forward" — and the file's own triage
  method ("match the symptom") won't route a reader here unless they
  already suspect coverage, not correctness, is the question.
- **Cause:** a PreToolUse-style gate only ever sees the tool call in front
  of it, at the moment it fires. It has no transcript access and no
  mechanism to scan backward: not the background processes already
  launched under the old pattern, not results already returned and
  believed, not commands already dispatched from earlier in the same
  session. (This is a property of tool-call gates specifically, not of
  every hook type — a Stop hook with transcript access, like the one
  behind entry 20, can and does look backward within a turn; the claim
  here is scoped to hooks that only ever see one tool call at a time.)
  "The guard is now live" and "every prior instance this session is
  accounted for" are two independent facts; shipping the hook only ever
  establishes the first.
- **Real case (2026-07-21, one day; recurred once, six days later):**
  `bg-exitcode-guard` blocks backgrounded Bash commands whose last
  statement is `echo`/`printf` after the script already captured `$?` — the
  always-zero echo/printf exit code overwrites the real command's exit code
  in the task-notification summary. The same session used that exact shape
  13 times within a single ~4.5-hour window on one day, before the hook
  existed. Once, it produced a genuinely misleading "completed (exit code
  0)" notification for a deploy that had actually failed three times in a
  row — and the operator caught the discrepancy within the same turn,
  inside a minute, by habitually re-grepping the real log instead of
  trusting the notification text: a near miss, not a believed-and-acted-on
  failure. After that day the pattern went completely dormant — zero
  backgrounded Bash calls of any kind — for six days, then recurred exactly
  once; the hook, freshly live, blocked it on its very first opportunity.
  None of the 13 pre-hook uses were still running by the time anyone
  looked — they had all already finished, and simply sat unexamined until
  an unrelated end-of-session review (not a sweep prompted by the hook
  itself) happened to check the transcript and surfaced the full count,
  the same day as the hook's only catch.
- **Fix:** don't treat "I have a habit of double-checking" as equivalent to
  "this is closed" — a habit is a per-instance save, not a guarantee, and
  the near miss above didn't stop anything on its own; the pattern simply
  went dormant for six days before recurring once more, and only the hook
  actually ended it. Two things follow, matched to what's actually
  checkable: (1) a genuinely in-flight task dispatched before the fix will
  still deliver its notification normally once it completes — Cause
  implies this risk, but none of the 13 real instances exercised it, since
  all of them had already finished by the time anyone looked — and there
  is no tool that lists "background tasks still outstanding from before
  this hook existed" to check for that in advance, so stay exactly as
  skeptical of a notification from something you dispatched under the old
  broken form as you are of a new one, since the hook cannot have
  retroactively fixed a command that's already running; (2) for the case
  that's actually common — already finished by the time the hook goes
  live — a deliberate sweep isn't the only path: if the session or
  environment already runs some later, broader check (an end-of-session
  review, a periodic audit), confirm it actually covers this exact gap
  rather than assuming it does. In the case above, that's literally what
  surfaced the true count of 13 uses — the same day as the hook's only
  catch, not a later sweep triggered by the fix itself. If the habit in
  (1) or the later check in (2) turns up an instance that was actually
  acted on, not just printed, treat it as its own live incident — verify
  what state it left behind before moving on.

## 27. A Stop hook's two runtime loop-protections both have blind spots — and a tool-calling remediation lands in both

- **Symptom:** a Stop hook fires several times inside what the user experiences
  as one request. Nothing errors. `stop_hook_active` is handled correctly. The
  documented consecutive-block ceiling never arrives.
- **Cause — the ceiling counts something narrower than its name suggests.**
  Claude Code caps consecutive Stop-hook blocks (default **8**, overridable via
  `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`; **setting it to `0` disables the cap
  rather than forbidding blocks** — the guard is `cap > 0 &&`). Those three facts
  were reverse-engineered here and have since been documented, `0`-disables
  included, so they are now checkable against the reference. **The mechanism below
  still is not**: the docs say only that the override lands after eight consecutive
  blocks "without progress", never defining what resets the count — so the next
  paragraph remains a binary-derived finding, not a documented contract, and should
  be re-verified against the CLI you are actually running. The counter driving it is
  **reset to 0 on every continuation that executed tools** — verified across all
  six continuation branches in 2.1.220, each of which writes the counter back as
  `0`; only the block branch increments it. So the cap's real meaning is *"blocked
  eight times in a row without the model doing anything in between"* — it catches
  a model that has stalled, not one that is diligently oscillating. **Any hook
  whose remediation involves tool calls keeps the counter pinned at 1 forever.**
  That is most Stop hooks worth writing: run the tests, dispatch the review,
  regenerate the artifact. Note also that when the cap *does* fire, the turn ends
  with `reason:"completed"` — the harness does not distinguish "forced abort"
  from "genuinely done" (contrast OpenHands, whose goal controller carries an
  explicit `complete` / `capped` split).
- **Cause — the other protection is one bit, not a counter.** `stop_hook_active`
  is a boolean: *"this turn has been blocked by a stop hook at least once."* The
  hook cannot learn how many times it has fired, so "let the third one through"
  is not expressible from the input alone. (Cursor hands its stop hook a numeric
  `loop_count` plus a configurable `loop_limit`; Claude Code hands you the bit.)
  The field is now documented — the reference states it is `true` "when Claude Code
  is already continuing as a result of a stop hook" and tells you to check it — but
  the documented prose stops there, and the property that actually bites is the one
  measured here: within one query loop it behaves as a **latch**, once true it stays
  true, so it cannot count and cannot tell your hook's block from another's.
- **What is NOT the cause (tested, so you don't repeat the experiment):**
  asynchronous background completions arriving *inside* the blocked window do
  **not** clear the latch. Measured over 7 headless runs on 2.1.220 — three with
  the notification verifiably landing after the block, including a real
  subagent reply — the latch held `true` every time. A plausible-sounding
  mechanism is not evidence; this one was wrong.
- **Honest boundary:** one observed session had a Stop hook block **four** times
  within a span containing a single real user message, each time with the latch
  `false` — so *something* started a fresh query loop between them, and the above
  rules out the obvious candidate. **The mechanism is unresolved.** That
  uncertainty is itself the argument for the fix: do not hang termination on a
  protection whose reset conditions you cannot predict.
- **Fix:**
  1. **Carry your own bound.** Neither runtime protection is one. If your hook
     demands a remediation, key a counter on something the hook computes itself
     (the turn-start offset it already derives, plus the session id) rather than
     on a runtime field.
  2. **Suppress the fires that are certainly useless — this is free.** The Stop
     input carries `background_tasks[]`, which lists still-running subagents
     (`type`, `status`, `agent_type`) and empties when they finish. If your
     remediation is "dispatch an agent," firing while that agent is still
     running is pure noise, and noise is what trains readers to ignore the hook
     (#2). Going quiet on non-empty `background_tasks` / `session_crons` is a
     **fact test, not a heuristic** — categorically unlike the semantic
     stuck-detection SWE-agent tried and abandoned for false positives. It
     defers rather than suppresses: the agent's return opens a new turn and the
     hook fires then.
  3. Sanity-check the shape first: #16 (is the predicate temporal, so the
     remediation re-arms it?) and #19 (does the remediation require memory that
     does not survive the call boundary?). This entry is about the layer
     underneath both — what the runtime does *not* do for you either way.
- **Self-test rows that see it:** same must-fire input three ways —
  `background_tasks` non-empty → quiet; `background_tasks: []` → still fires;
  `session_crons` non-empty → quiet. The middle row is the one people skip, and
  without it you cannot distinguish "gate works" from "gate swallows
  everything." Verified by mutation: forcing the gate true fails many rows,
  forcing it false fails **exactly** the two quiet rows — proving no pre-existing
  fixture covered the gate.

## Meta-principle: the ordering of these fixes

When a guard is misbehaving, check in this order — cheapest and most common first:
1. Is it **allowing everything**? → stdin/heredoc (#1) or wrong `tool_name` gate.
2. Is it **blocking a healthy command**? → awk-split / presence-not-position (#2).
3. Did **unrelated Bash calls** break right after you touched it? → corruption (#3), run `bash -n`.
4. Does the **banned action still happen**? → escape hatch (#4) or wrong profile (#5) or dead symlink (#6).
5. Is `bash -n` clean but **one specific case still gives the wrong answer**
   (and you recently edited an embedded `python3 -c "…"` block, code or
   comments)? → quote/backtick corruption (#9) — `bash -n` cannot see this one,
   only a real-JSON test of that exact case will.
6. Did it stop mid-run with **`Failed with non-blocking status code: No stderr
   output`**, in a hook whose contract is always-exit-0? → `set -e` + `pipefail`
   killing it on a legitimately-empty `grep`/`wc` (#8). Distinct symptom, distinct
   fix: drop `-e`, or `||`-guard every such pipeline.
7. Did your **own test command** get blocked while you were testing the guard you
   just registered? → self-block (#7); move the cases into a script file so the
   outer command doesn't carry the trigger.
8. Does it work when you run the command **in place**, but never fire when the
   command `cd`s somewhere first (or uses `~`, a variable, a glob)? → the guard is
   parsing command text and got an unexpanded string (#10). Note this one has **no
   symptom of its own** when the hook fails open — you find it by testing the
   `cd ~/elsewhere && …` shape explicitly, not by waiting for something to look wrong.
9. Does it pass every fixture but **barely fire on a real corpus** — and the missed
   commands are **multiline / newline-separated** (as opposed to #10's single-line
   `cd ~/x && …` with an unexpanded `~`)? → newline-blind segmentation (#11): the
   tokenizer drops the newline in real multiline commands, so the head is `cd`. Also
   suspect the replay/mutation **harness** itself — make it report "dirty" on a
   known-positive before trusting its "clean".
10. Is one **branch** of the hook — an optional paragraph, a kind-specific check —
    never firing, while everything else works? → either the branch is reading the
    hook's own **display string** and the item fell past a truncation (#12), or the
    **classifier** never produced that kind at all because it keys on a naming
    convention this repo doesn't follow (#13). Distinguish by printing the raw
    classification before it is formatted: present-but-truncated is #12,
    never-classified is #13.
11. Is the suite **green while the output is visibly wrong**? → the assertions only
    check exit codes and this hook's product is its text (#14). Add both-polarity
    content assertions, then mutate to prove they can die.
12. Does it report a file **nobody wrote** — especially one containing a literal
    `$VAR`? → it is reading command text as if every redirect in it executed (#15).
13. Does a **Stop hook** fire **again right after you did exactly what it asked**
    (the turn ends, work happens, and the NEXT stop re-fires on the same grounds)?
    → its condition is a temporal comparison that the remediation itself moves (#16).
    Not a tuning problem: change the predicate's *shape* — move the gate to the
    action with PreToolUse, or test an existence fact keyed on the thing that
    needed remediating — and add the after-remediation row pair that a
    point-in-time suite structurally cannot have. (Same "recurring fire" symptom
    as 15/16 below — split by hook type and by what you check first.)
14. Did it catch the first violation and **silently never mention the second one
    from the same reply**? → first-only reporting (#17): the honored retry round
    is a full pass-through, so collect every finding before printing and assert
    both hits in a two-violations fixture.
15. Did the **same block error return after you "fixed" it** — and your fix was
    bundled into the same command as the gated one? → innocent-segment
    side effects swallowed (#18): separate state changes from gated commands
    into their own Bash call, and after any block re-verify writes you assumed
    had landed. (Cheapest check in the recurrence family — one grep — so run it
    before 13/16's deeper reads.)
16. Does a **PreToolUse hook** block you **repeatedly for the same thing despite
    complying** each time (the block arrives before the command even runs)?
    → the remediation demands cross-call memory (#19): it's a class
    property, not carelessness — fix the environment, downgrade to a reminder,
    or accept-and-measure; a clearer message was never the missing piece.
17. Does a turn-scoped hook see **neither the work nor the review** that should
    bound it — quiet when it should fire, or firing when the review already
    happened? → the window/channel logic is eating system records: agent
    deliveries counted as turn starts truncate the detection window (#20), and
    environment-schema drift blinds the review channel (rule 7's observability
    form — verify the predicate can see R in EVERY environment, not just the
    one you fixture-tested).
18. Does a resolution step hand you the **wrong entity** — a verdict meant for
    A landing on B, or a decision inverted (delegation stamped as review /
    review read as delegation)? → prefix resolution without a typed tail (#21):
    globs must anchor on delimiter+type (name-hex.jsonl, not name-*), flag
    families need enumeration + arity, and segment state machines need the last
    NON-EMPTY head — and only a fixture containing the colliding pair proves
    resolution, a singleton proves nothing.
19. Is the **machine itself** hot under parallel agent sessions — spawn rate
    sustained at 40+/s, `syspolicyd` atop the all-day CPU ranking, and NO
    runaway process anywhere? → fork multiplier (#22): the fleet's per-call
    irrelevant path is the load. Slim every guard's fast path to zero forks;
    do not "fix" it by deleting guards.

## 28. The fallback target is right for one reason and wrong for another — and both print the same line

> Worked example in this repo's sibling tooling: `git-push-verify.sh` and
> `git-commit-headcheck.sh` (a private hooks repo, not shipped here) both had
> exactly this defect and were fixed on 2026-08-04 by the prescription below.
> Naming them matters — the entry is useless if you cannot go read a before/after.

- **Symptom:** a verification hook reports a clean, confident, *correct* fact —
  about the wrong object. `git push` to repo B triggers a push-verifier that
  answers with repo A's HEAD, compares it against repo A's remote, and prints
  `✅ push 已落地`. Nothing errored. The hash it printed is real. The comparison
  it performed is sound. It just wasn't about the push you ran. And the message
  opens with `权威源` / "authoritative — do not trust the in-command output",
  which is an instruction to discard the very observation that would have caught
  it.

- **Cause — two different reasons for falling back share one fallback value.**
  Such a hook derives its target from the command text (`git -C <path> …`) and
  falls back to the event's `cwd` when it can't. That fallback is correct for
  *one* of the two reasons it triggers and wrong for the other, and the code
  path is identical:

  | command | target parsed | falls back? | event cwd | verdict |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `git push` | none — **there is no explicit target** | yes | the real target | ✅ correct |
  | `git -C /literal/p push` | `/literal/p` | no | — | ✅ correct |
  | `R=/p; git -C $R push` | `$R` — **explicit target, unreadable value** | yes | *not* the target | ❌ **bound to the wrong object** |

  Rows 1 and 3 emit byte-identical shapes. The hook cannot tell them apart, and
  neither can the reader: one is the strongest verdict the hook can give, the
  other is that same verdict about an unrelated repository. Note the variable is
  not exotic — assigning a path once and reusing it is ordinary shell, and it is
  *more* likely in exactly the multi-repo sessions where the failure bites.

  This is the checking-tool form of the **confused deputy** problem (Hardy,
  1988): a component with the authority to answer becomes confused about *which
  object it is answering for*. The security literature's diagnostic questions
  port over directly — "who is the real requester? what resource is actually
  being touched?" — and for a hook they become **"which target did the command
  name, and is that the one I measured?"**

- **The assumption that hides it.** Both hooks carried a comment asserting this
  fallback was safe *because* "the wrong path will just fail to read, so the
  failure direction is fail-loud — there is no false-green path here." That is
  the reasoning to distrust. It holds only if the fallback lands somewhere
  invalid; in a multi-repo session it lands in **another valid repository**, so
  the read succeeds and returns a real, checkable, entirely irrelevant fact. The
  false green grew directly out of the belief that a false green was impossible.
  When you write "this can only fail loudly," name the input that would make it
  fail quietly and go check that input exists.

- **Why this is worse than a hook that fails open.** A fail-open hook (pitfall
  #10) produces silence, and silence is at least honest about carrying no
  information. This produces a *positive verdict with the wrong referent*, wearing
  the vocabulary of authority. It also survives the reader's instinct to
  double-check, because there is nothing to double-check: the command succeeded,
  the output is well-formed, the hash is real.

- **Fix — make the fallback carry its own reason, and downgrade the one that
  can't be trusted.**
  1. **Distinguish "no explicit target" from "explicit target, unresolvable."**
     Only the first may silently adopt the event `cwd`. The second must refuse
     to render a verdict: `目标是 $VAR，无法解析——本 hook 未核对，请手动比对`.
     A hook that says "I didn't check" costs one manual check; one that says
     "✅" about another object costs the thing it was built to protect.
  2. **Put the referent where it is read, not where it is skipped.** If the
     message must carry a caveat, it belongs *before* the verdict, not after it.
     A trailing "⚠️ if the repo above isn't the one you pushed, this line is
     unrelated" is a correct sentence that arrives after the reader has already
     banked the ✅.
  3. **Never claim more authority than the binding supports.** `权威源` is
     earned by the *measurement* (asking the remote) and spent by the *binding*
     (which repo). A hook whose binding is heuristic should not use the
     vocabulary of a hook whose binding is exact.

- **How this hides during development.** The author writes fixtures with literal
  paths, because that is how you write a readable test. Literal paths are row 2 —
  the one that works. The failure needs a variable, which appears in real
  sessions and almost never in fixtures. Add a fixture whose target is a shell
  variable and assert on the *rendered target string*, not on the exit code
  (pitfall #14's rule applied here: for a hook whose product is text, the exit
  code proves nothing).

- **Calibration note for anyone tempted to "just always warn."** Research on static-analysis
  alerts reports that a large majority of warnings go unacted-on — the
  frequently-cited range is roughly **35%–91%** (Heckman & Williams' work on
  actionable-vs-unactionable warnings is the usual entry point), with
  false-positive rates reaching ~90% in some tools, and names the resulting
  desensitisation *alert fatigue*. (Figures quoted from secondary summaries;
  search "actionable static analysis warnings" for the primary sources and their
  datasets.) That is the budget a hook spends
  every time it emits an unreliable line. Choosing "I didn't check" over a
  confident wrong answer is not timidity; it is spending that budget on the
  cases that earn it.

**The later entries route by shape, not by symptom order** (they were added after
this list and describe defects you reach by asking a different question):

- Does the guard **read a flag as data**, or drop a token it should have judged?
  → arity table vs. the real tool (#23); boundary-regex negated class (#24).
- Does the guard **block its own maintenance** — its health check, its fix commit,
  its own read path? → read forms not modelled (#25); and #7 for the fix-commit form.
- Is the guard **correct from now on but blind to what already happened**?
  → mid-session activation guards only the future (#26).
- Is a **Stop hook firing more times than the documented cap allows**?
  → both loop-protections have blind spots (#27).
- Does the guard emit a **confident verdict about the wrong object** — right facts,
  wrong referent, no error anywhere? → fallback target sharing one value for two
  different reasons (#28). This one does not announce itself as a malfunction;
  you find it by asking "which target did the command name, and is that the one
  the guard measured?"
- Does the guard **look like it fires but never actually blocks** — the guidance
  prints, the state is written, yet the exit code is 0 every time? → a trailing
  `exit 0` swallowing the decision (#29).
- Did a **UserPromptSubmit hook** fire with **no human message anywhere nearby**
  in the transcript? → it fired on a task-notification's own text, not a
  keystroke (#30) — the stdin JSON has nothing that says which.
- Did a **staleness/compounding tracker** re-fire on a file you did **not**
  touch this round, even after you wrote down exactly why the touched one
  didn't need another pass? → it tracks file *kind*, not the specific diff,
  and nothing in it reads prose (#31).
- Does the guard **block a dangerous command alone but allow it once unrelated
  text is combined with it** — four comment lines in front, say? → two parallel
  arrays, the text and its quote mask, drifting out of alignment (#32).
- Does the guard **block the typed form but allow the same argv** reached
  through brace expansion, ANSI-C quoting, or `${IFS:0:1}`? → a shlex-based
  guard judging the text you typed, not the argv bash builds (#33).
- Is a PostToolUse hook **silent exactly on the calls whose command failed**,
  while every other Bash call triggers it? → failures route to
  `PostToolUseFailure`, which was never registered (#34).
- Does an existence probe's `|| echo` fallback **never fire**, so an empty
  result could mean "found nothing" or "died upstream"? → `||` binds to the
  last pipeline segment, and `head`/`tail`/`wc`/`cat` exit 0 on empty input
  (#35). With `grep` last, it does fire, but identically in both cases.
- Is an agent's **review-and-fix cycle expanding without end**, each round
  justified on its own? → a self-applied review rule with no loop key, failure
  axis, or cycle budget; no hook is needed for this one (#36).
- Does a review-loop guard **stay silent through the exact repeat it exists to
  catch** — three review dispatches on one artifact, back to back? → its
  keyword whitelist misses the wording real prompts use (#37).
- Is a registered, executable, syntax-clean injecting hook **producing no
  output, session after session, with no error**? → it reads the prompt from
  an environment variable the host never sets (#38).
- Does a hook fail with **"No such file or directory" for a script that
  exists** and runs fine by hand from the repo root? → a relative path in the
  project's `.claude/settings.json`, resolved against the session's cwd (#39).
- Does an injected message **come out with a passage missing**, stderr showing
  `command not found` and the exit code still 0? → an unquoted heredoc running
  the prose's markdown backticks as commands (#40).
- Does a "re-run when this file changes" scheduler **run its expensive check
  once and never again**? → `stat` without `-L` reading the symlink's mtime,
  not the file it points to (#41).
- Does a `--selftest` **pass by its SSOT path but fail from the health check**,
  every session? → a sibling lookup from `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"`, which
  is the symlink's directory (#42).
- Does an auditor over the registered hooks **skip some as unreadable while
  they are live and firing**? → it expands `~` but not a literal `$HOME`
  spelling (#43).
- Is a human confirmation gate **firing constantly, approved within seconds,
  with a dialog that lists nothing to decide**? → the dialog is built from
  pre-command state, empty by construction on the new trigger path (#44).
- Does the model **follow a block's printed remedy exactly and get blocked
  again** on the same grounds, round after round? → a remedy sanitized for
  display, or self-checked with a different parser than the gate's own (#45).
- Is a suite **green and growing while the defect it covers ships anyway**,
  with a deliberate break turning nothing red, or a row red for the wrong
  reason? → assertions that never reach the condition they claim to test
  (#46).
- Does `--fire-rate` or a similar subcommand **print
  `syntax error in expression`, then hang or exit 0 without its report**, on
  some inputs only? → a `$(( ))` error discarding the whole branch, `exit`
  included, so the main path runs (#47). In a `--selftest` branch the same
  fall-through reports a pass.
- Did a suite row **fail right after your edit, on machinery your edit never
  touched**? → the suite may have been red for days before you arrived; run it
  at HEAD first or you will debug someone else's rot as your regression (#48).
- Did you edit a guard's classifier and **the next health check stayed green
  without re-running its full battery**? → the scheduler signs the registered
  wrapper, not the sibling `.py` it runs or the modules that file imports (#49).

## 29. A trailing `exit 0` swallows the exit-code decision — the message prints, the state writes, the guard never blocks

> Worked example: `same-cmd-resend-guard.sh` (a private hooks repo, not shipped
> here), 2026-08-08. A PreToolUse guard whose fire-path ended in python
> `sys.exit(2)` also ended the bash script with an unconditional `exit 0`
> (added as a "safety" line so the script never returned non-zero outside its
> python block). The `exit 0` ran **after** the heredoc, unconditionally
> overriding the python exit code. The guard's entire decision — "block this" —
> was thrown away on every fire.

- **Symptom:** the hook *looks alive*. Run it by hand and it prints the guidance
  to stderr. The state file it writes appears. `bash -n` passes. An end-to-end
  test that only checks "did the message print" passes. But the harness sees
  `exit 0` every time — the block never happens, the model never sees the
  guidance in-session, and the guard is a silent no-op for its entire life. This
  is the "绿成常态 = 没拦" shape: green everywhere, nothing enforced.

- **Why this is worse than a miss.** A guard that never fires is a miss on every
  input, forever — and it *looks* like a working guard (message prints, state
  writes, tests pass). It survives until an independent reader checks the exit
  code itself, because the author's own end-to-end test asserted the wrong
  observable (stderr) and never asserted the decision channel (exit code).

- **Fix — the script's exit code must BE the decision, and the test must assert
  it.**
  1. **Do not add a trailing `exit 0` to a PreToolUse hook that decides.** The
     bash script's exit code is its contract; the last command (the python
     heredoc, or an explicit `exit "$?"`) must be what the harness sees. If the
     python block has fail-open branches, express them *inside* python
     (`sys.exit(0)` on the allow paths), not as a shell-level override after it.
     If python3 is missing, the heredoc's exit 127 is a "non-blocking error"
     which the harness treats as proceed — that is already the fail-open you
     wanted; you do not need the `exit 0`.
  2. **Assert the exit code, not just the stderr.** For a guard whose product is
     a decision, `says` (stderr) rows are necessary but not sufficient — a
     `sys.exit(2)` swallowed by a later `exit 0` keeps every `says` row green.
     Add `assert_exit 2` on the fire path and `assert_exit 0` on every allow
     path, and **mutation-test the exit-code row**: reintroduce the bug (add the
     `exit 0` back), confirm the suite goes red on the exit-code assertion.
     (This pitfall was itself caught that way — the exit-code row is what turned
     red when the bug was re-injected.)
  3. **Watch the "message prints" trap in your own calibration.** Seeing the
     guidance on stderr when you run the hook by hand is not proof the harness
     will block — stderr shows on allow too. The decision channel is the exit
     code; test the channel, not the ink.

- **Sibling form: a top-level `trap 'exit 0' EXIT` does the same to
  `--selftest`.** Some always-exit-0 hooks enforce the contract with a trap on
  EXIT at the top of the file instead of the ERR trap in SKILL.md's "-e or
  trap" bullet. An EXIT trap that runs `exit 0` replaces whatever status the
  script was about to exit with, so a failing `--selftest` that ends in
  `exit 1` exits 0 (measured on bash 3.2.57 and 5.3.15). The selftest still
  prints its failures, but the health check reads only the status, so the hook
  can never be reported broken. The ERR trap is not immune either: placed above
  the dispatch, it turns any unexpected failing command inside `--selftest`
  into a silent exit 0, with or without `-e` (also measured on both versions),
  so a selftest whose own plumbing broke reports a pass.
  - **Fix:** install the trap, EXIT or ERR, after the subcommand dispatch, on
    the main path only, or clear it with `trap - EXIT` / `trap - ERR` as the
    first line of the selftest branch. Build-order step 4 already asks you to
    break the detector on purpose and confirm `--selftest` exits non-zero; that
    calibration catches the EXIT-trap form on its first run.
  - **Real case (2026-09-23, a private hooks repository):** an advisory hook
    had shipped the day before with the EXIT trap at the top of the file, and
    a mutant whose detector fired on every input printed `FAILED` eleven times
    and exited 0. Sweeping the same repository afterwards found the ERR form in
    two more hooks; a mutant that put a failing command at the top of each
    selftest exited 0 in both.

## 30. UserPromptSubmit fires on task-notification arrival too — the stdin JSON has no field that says so

> Worked example: `workshop-skill-loader.sh` (a private hooks repo, not shipped
> here), 2026-08-11. A `UserPromptSubmit` hook that keyword-scans `.prompt` for
> content-writing triggers fired the moment a background subagent's
> task-notification landed — no human had typed anything in between.

- **Symptom:** a `UserPromptSubmit` hook injects its reminder at a moment when
  the transcript shows no new human message anywhere nearby — only a
  `<task-notification>` that just arrived (a background agent reporting
  completion). The hook's own logic is correct: it read `.prompt`, found
  matching keywords, fired exactly as designed. The keywords it matched came
  from the **notification's own report text**, not from anything the user
  wrote.

- **Cause — this repo's own "UserPromptSubmit only ever sees user input" claim
  (SKILL.md, the Stop-vs-UserPromptSubmit bullet) is stated as a clean binary
  and misses a third source.** Verified directly against this session's
  transcript JSONL, not inferred: a task-notification lands as a `type:"user"`
  record tagged `origin: {"kind": "task-notification"}`,
  `promptSource: "system"` — Claude Code's own data model already distinguishes
  it from a genuine keystroke, which arrives as `origin: {"kind": "human"}`,
  `promptSource: "typed"`. Immediately following it, an `attachment` record of
  `type: "task_reminder"` (empty, `content: []`) appears, and chained to
  *that* via `parentUuid`, an `attachment` of `type: "hook_success"` with
  `hookName: "UserPromptSubmit"` — proof the harness invoked the hook on this
  turn, not on a human's. **But `origin` and `promptSource` are transcript
  metadata, not part of what the hook receives.** The official hooks reference
  documents `UserPromptSubmit`'s stdin JSON as `session_id`, `transcript_path`,
  `cwd`, `permission_mode`, `hook_event_name`, `prompt_id`, and `prompt` —
  no `origin`, no `source`, nothing that tells the hook *why* this invocation
  happened. A hook that keyword-scans `.prompt` without looking at how it
  *begins* cannot tell "the user asked for this" from "a notification's own
  text satisfied my regex". No field marks the difference; the one in-band
  signal is the wrapper tag `.prompt` opens with (Fix 4).

- **Why the existing framing undersells the risk.** "UserPromptSubmit only
  sees user input" reads as reassurance — *whatever* fires it, at least it's
  something the user meant. This incident shows the event fires on **content
  Claude itself produced two hops earlier** (a subagent's own summary,
  re-surfacing as this turn's effective prompt) — the exact category of text
  the Stop-vs-UserPromptSubmit bullet says this event "structurally cannot
  see." It can, just not labeled as such, and not through the path anyone
  would guess.

- **Fix:**
  1. **Gate on `origin.kind == "human"` alone — don't also require
     `promptSource == "typed"`.** `promptSource` answers a different question
     (*how* the text entered: at the moment of submission, `"typed"`, or while
     a prior turn was still running, `"queued"`) and is not itself a
     human/non-human signal — a genuine, substantive human message can carry
     `promptSource: "queued"` with `origin.kind` still `"human"` (verified
     directly in this session's own transcript: a real, several-sentence human
     request has exactly this shape). Requiring `promptSource == "typed"` in
     the same condition looks like the natural tightening — it's the value a
     keystroke at idle carries — but it silently rejects real user input the
     instant it arrives mid-turn instead of at idle: `promptSource` is not
     part of the human/non-human distinction at all.
     `origin` absent, or `kind` anything else (`"task-notification"`, or the
     `None`/`None` shape a Stop-hook-injected turn carries), means this
     invocation did not originate from a keystroke.
  2. **Open `transcript_path` and look up `promptId` — camelCase, not the
     `prompt_id` your own stdin JSON gave you.** The hook receives
     `prompt_id` (snake_case, per the official schema) on stdin; the matching
     transcript JSONL record carries it under `promptId` (camelCase) —
     searching the transcript for the literal string `prompt_id` returns
     nothing. Same twin-blind-spot shape #20 warns about, different field.
     `transcript_path` is JSONL (one record per line) and is written
     **asynchronously** — the official docs note it can lag behind the
     current turn, so the record you want may not have landed yet. The safe
     fallback is the last `type:"user"` record; this skill's
     `hook_patterns.md` Pattern E already ships working, tested code for
     tailing and parsing it — use that rather than re-deriving the parse.
  3. **This costs one JSON read, not a rewrite.** The hook still reads
     `.prompt` for its keyword match — the added step is one extra field check
     against the transcript's *last* record before acting on a match, not a
     new event type or a different hook.
  4. **Team-mode deliveries fire the hook too — and the hook does not receive
     what the transcript stores.** Anything that can inject a `type:"user"`
     record with a non-`"human"` `origin` — a Stop-hook's own
     `additionalContext` re-surfacing, a teammate or cross-session delivery —
     is the same shape from a `UserPromptSubmit` hook's point of view. Two
     sources, both read directly, not inferred:
     - **The hook's own stdin.** A production `UserPromptSubmit` hook (a
       private hooks repo, not shipped here) logs the first 120 characters of
       `.prompt` each time its keyword trigger matches. In six weeks of that
       log (2026-08-05 → 2026-09-20), `.prompt` *began with the bare wrapper
       tag* 68 times: `<task-notification` 30, `<agent-message` 29,
       `<cross-session-message` 9. Seven more entries (`<teammate-message` 4,
       `<agent-message` 3), all within 99 seconds on 2026-08-05, began with
       the sentence `Another Claude session sent a message:` and only then
       the tag. That rendering never recurs in the log, and neither does
       `<teammate-message`.
     - **The transcript** (one team-mode session, 2026-09-20).
       `<agent-message from="…">` and `<cross-session-message from="…">` land
       as `type:"user"` records with `origin: {"kind": "peer"}`,
       `promptSource: "system"`; `<teammate-message …>` records carry neither
       key. None is `"human"`, so Fix 1 excludes all three. The 28
       `hook_success`/`UserPromptSubmit` attachments that followed an
       `<agent-message>` record were each written 0.05–0.23 s after it and at
       least 269 s from any human input.

     The two disagree on the detail that decides how to match. The transcript
     stores every one of these deliveries behind `Another Claude session sent
     a message:`; that same day the hook's `.prompt` opened with the bare
     `<agent-message` tag 9 times out of 9. #20's wrapper forms describe the
     transcript — anchored on `.prompt`, that sentence would have missed all
     68 bare-tag entries. So a hook that only needs "is this a delivery?" can
     skip the transcript, and Fix 2's async-write lag with it: look for the
     wrapper tag in `.prompt`. In every logged delivery the tag sat at the
     very start or directly after that one sentence, which leaves a choice:
     match it as a substring when acting on machine text is the costlier
     error (a human who quotes the tag gets skipped), or anchor it at the
     start, with the sentence optional, when skipping a human is. Match the
     symptom (fired with no nearby human message in the transcript), not the
     specific trigger (task-notification here, something else next time).

## 31. A compounding-tracker keyed on file *kind* re-flags files nobody touched — and a written justification can't clear it, because nothing reads prose

> Worked example: `compounding-edit-review.sh` (a private hooks repo, not
> shipped here), 2026-08-11/12. A Stop hook that nags for independent review
> of "复利产物" (compounding artifacts — skill files, marketplace registry)
> fired three times across one continuous editing session on the same
> four-file group, the third time **after** the author had written and
> committed an explicit "why this edit doesn't need another review" note.

- **Symptom:** the hook's own instructions offer two valid closes: dispatch a
  fresh independent-review pass, **or** — when the latest edit is a
  narrow, verified, review-prescribed fix — write the reasoning into the
  review record and pass. The author does the second, correctly (the fix's
  exact wording came from the prior review's own suggestion, its underlying
  fact independently `git grep`-verified). The hook fires again anyway, next
  turn, listing the **same file list**, only one of which was actually
  touched by the edit in question.

- **Cause — the tracked unit is broader than the thing being justified.**
  The hook persists a per-session ledger (JSON, one record per tracked
  "turn"): a `kinds` array (e.g. `["marketplace","skill asset","skill"]`,
  accumulated across every edit in that turn) and a `fires` counter, `causes`
  logging `"none"` (nothing reviewed yet) then `"stale"` (something was
  reviewed, but a later edit to a file of one of the tracked *kinds*
  postdates it). Once a `kind` enters that array, re-editing **any file of
  that kind** — not the specific file the last review covered — re-triggers
  the whole group. A one-line SKILL.md wording fix and a from-scratch new
  script both count as "touched the `skill` kind" identically. The written
  justification lives in a markdown file the hook never opens; the ledger
  only ever compares **timestamps against a kind**, so prose reasoning has
  no channel to reach it. This is not a bug in the justification path — it
  is the absence of one: the escape hatch the hook's own message describes
  is real (a human reading it can apply it), but nothing in the hook's own
  mechanism *checks* whether it was used correctly, because the mechanism
  doesn't parse markdown.

- **Why this is a design smell worth generalizing, not just a false alarm.**
  A staleness tracker whose granularity is coarser than the thing it asks the
  author to justify will always eventually re-fire on work already justified
  — not because the author did anything wrong, but because "kind" and
  "specific diff" are different units and the hook only measures the first.
  Left alone, this either burns real review cycles on content a human has
  already reasoned through carefully (expensive but survivable), or — the
  worse failure mode — teaches the author that the written-justification
  option "doesn't actually work," so they stop trying it and every future
  edit gets the heavier treatment regardless of whether it needs it (the
  same over-broad-check tax described in the calibration note under #28).

- **Fix:**
  1. **Key the staleness check on the file, not the kind — or make the
     coarser key explicit and budgeted, not silent.** If per-kind tracking is
     intentional (grouping small related edits so a session doesn't get
     nagged once per file), give it a stated ceiling — this repo's own
     `max_fires` config is exactly that pattern — and surface *why* it's
     firing again ("this kind was touched N times since last review, not
     this exact file") so the author can tell "genuinely unreviewed content"
     from "the bucket reset because a sibling file changed."
  2. **A written-justification escape hatch needs a channel the hook actually
     reads**, not just a convention documented in the hook's own stderr
     message. Either the hook parses a small structured marker (a
     `reviewed-through: <commit-sha>` line the author writes and the hook
     greps for) or the hatch is honest about being a **human-facing
     convention**, not a **hook-enforced** one — and the hook's message
     should say so, rather than presenting "write the reasoning and pass" as
     if it clears the ledger.
  3. **Don't spend a fourth review round arguing with the mechanism.** Once
     you've confirmed (as here) that the re-fire is the kind-vs-file
     granularity gap and not a genuine new gap in review coverage, the
     correct move is exactly what the hook's own exhaustion message says:
     treat the budget as spent, not as "clean," and — if the pattern
     recurs — fix the tracker's granularity rather than writing a fourth
     justification the mechanism will not read either.

## 32. Two parallel arrays indexed by the same offsets are an unstated invariant — and orthogonal test axes never cross the point where it breaks

> Worked example: `git-commit-form-guard.sh` (a private hooks repo, not
> shipped here), 2026-08-16. A quote-aware redirect stripper built one
> character-mask array alongside the text array it masks, then indexed the
> mask with the text's match offsets. One branch appended to the text array
> and not the mask. Measured result: `git commit -a` — the exact form this
> Tier-0 guard exists to block — sailed through with exit 0.

- **Symptom:** the guard blocks correctly in isolation and fails only in
  combination. `git commit -a -m "wip >log"` blocks (exit 2). Prefix the
  same command with four comment lines and it **allows** (exit 0). Nothing
  about the diagnostic output distinguishes the two — the guard simply
  returns 0 the way it does for every healthy command, so the failure is
  indistinguishable from correct operation unless you already suspect it.

- **Cause — the invariant was real but unwritten.** The scanner walks the
  command character by character, appending to `out` (the rewritten text)
  and to `qmask` (is this character inside quotes?). A later regex pass
  strips redirects, skipping any match whose span is quoted:
  `if any(qmask[m.start():m.end()]): continue`. That slice is only
  meaningful while `len(qmask) == len(out)`. The comment-terminating branch
  appended `";"` to `out` and nothing to `qmask`, so **each comment line
  shifts the mask one position left** relative to the text it describes.
  Note the shift is unbounded and cumulative — it grows with input, so
  there is no "small enough" input that is safe.

- **Why the consequence is worse than "strips slightly wrong."** The
  displaced window eventually lands entirely outside the quotes it should
  have been inside, so the stripper eats the message's **closing quote**.
  The now-unbalanced text raises `ValueError` from the tokenizer, and this
  guard's documented convention is `except ValueError: sys.exit(0)` —
  fail-open. So a pure *offset* bug is laundered into a **complete bypass**
  of the gate. Generalize: in any fail-open parser, a corruption bug and a
  disable switch are the same bug. Audit what your `except` clauses exit
  with before you add anything that can throw.

- **Why the test suite was green — the axes never crossed.** The suite had
  redirect cases (added the day before, deliberately, with negative
  controls) and comment cases (long-standing). **Every redirect case had
  zero comments; every comment case had zero redirects.** Each axis was
  covered; their intersection was empty; the bug lives only in the
  intersection. Coverage counted per-axis reads as thorough and is blind
  by construction.

- **Why a first probe said "no fail-open" and was wrong.** Testing comment
  counts 0–3 against a few message shapes returns all-blocked, which reads
  as a clean bill of health. The offset grows one position per comment, so
  whether the window clears the quote depends on **both** the comment count
  and the message length — for the shapes probed, the flip started at
  k=4. A single sampled value of a linear parameter is not a test of that
  parameter. Sweep it, or you will certify the safe cell and ship the
  unsafe one.

**Fixes, in the order they buy the most:**

1. **Make the invariant executable, not documentary — but check which way
   your "loud failure" actually falls.** A comment saying "these must stay
   equal" is not enforcement; the next person appending a branch will not
   read it. The reflex is `assert len(qmask) == len(out)` — and in this
   guard that reflex was **measured to be wrong, in the dangerous
   direction**. This block returns its verdict on **stdout** (the shell does
   `FORM=$(python3 …)`) and always `sys.exit(0)` itself, so an uncaught
   `AssertionError` prints nothing to stdout, leaves `FORM` empty, reads as
   "no violation found", and exits the hook **1** — and PreToolUse treats
   any nonzero-but-not-2 as a non-blocking error, so the tool runs anyway.
   Forcing the assertion to fire measured exactly that: `git commit -a -m x`
   → exit 1 → allowed. Replacing it with an explicit `if len(qmask) !=
   len(out): report_violation()` measured exit 2 for both the dangerous and
   the healthy command — conservative, which is the correct direction for a
   Tier-0 gate. **Generalize: whether a tripwire is fail-open or fail-closed
   is a property of how *the call site consumes the result*, not of the
   language construct.** The same `assert` is fail-closed in a hook whose
   exit code is the verdict and fail-open in a block whose stdout is the
   verdict. Determine this by forcing the failure and reading the exit code,
   not by intuition. Better still, remove the invariant's ability to break:
   append `(char, in_quote)` **tuples** to one array so no branch *can*
   update one without the other. Two arrays that must stay in lockstep are
   a data-structure choice you can simply decline to make.
2. **Test the product of your axes, not their union.** When you add axis B
   to a suite that already covers axis A, add A×B cases in the same commit.
   The cheap version: for each existing A case, re-run it with the smallest
   nonzero amount of B. This is the same discipline as the negative
   controls elsewhere in this file — the difference is that a missing
   *intersection* looks like coverage on every count you can take.
3. **Sweep parameters that shift an offset; don't sample them.** If a
   quantity in the input moves an index (count of comments, lines,
   escapes, nesting depth), enumerate a range of it in the suite (here:
   1..8, each as its own case) rather than picking one value. State the
   reason in the test file so a later reader doesn't "tidy" eight cases
   into one.
4. **Calibrate bidirectionally against a single-line revert.** Build a copy
   of the guard with *only* the fix undone and run the suite against it.
   The result must be red **and** red in exactly the new cases — here 58
   pass / 16 fail, with the 16 being precisely the added intersection
   cases. If reverting the fix leaves the suite green, the tests are
   decoration; if it reddens unrelated cases, the fix did more than
   claimed. (Watch for artifacts: copies must be `chmod +x` if the suite
   execs the hook — an all-`126` run is "permission denied," not a signal.)
5. **Weigh a Tier-0 bypass by reachability, not by corpus frequency.**
   Replaying 142,687 real commands found only 8 where this misalignment
   changed the parse, and none of those contained `git commit` — so the
   bug had never actually fired in production. That is a fact worth
   recording and worth *not* using as a severity discount: the input that
   triggers it is trivially constructible and entirely ordinary (a comment
   above a commit). Frequency data tells you whether you were lucky, not
   whether the gate holds.

## 33. A shlex-based guard sees the text you typed, not the argv bash builds — every shell expansion is a hole in it

> Worked example: `git-commit-form-guard.sh` (a private hooks repo, not
> shipped here), 2026-08-16, found by an independent fresh-context reviewer
> after the author had already declared the guard sound. Three separate,
> zero-setup, everyday-syntax ways to make the guard's own target form
> (`git commit -a`) invisible to it, all present since the guard's earliest
> commit, one of them pushed all the way through to a real `git commit` that
> genuinely swept uncommitted work into the tree.

- **Symptom:** the guard blocks `git commit -a -m x` (exit 2) and allows all
  of these (exit 0), each of which bash executes as *exactly that command*:

  | typed | bash's real argv |
  |---|---|
  | `git commit {-a,-m} x` | `commit` `-a` `-m` `x` (brace expansion) |
  | `git commit $'-a' -m x` | `commit` `-a` `-m` `x` (ANSI-C quoting) |
  | `git${IFS:0:1}commit${IFS:0:1}-a` | `git` `commit` `-a` (IFS as separator) |

- **Cause — a category error about what the tokenizer is for.** `shlex` is a
  *lexer*: it splits text into words and handles quoting. Bash, before it
  ever has an argv, additionally performs brace expansion, tilde expansion,
  parameter/variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,
  word splitting, and pathname expansion. `shlex` does **none** of these and
  never claims to. So `{-a,-m}` arrives as one literal token beginning with
  `{`, which never reaches a flag scanner that only fires on tokens
  beginning with `-`. The guard is not buggy in its own terms; it is
  answering a different question than the one that matters ("what did the
  user type" vs "what will actually run").

- **Why this outranks the disclaimer the guard already had.** This guard
  already declared variable indirection (`G=git; $G commit -am`) an accepted
  false negative. That disclaimer does not cover these: `$G` requires the
  user to have written an assignment first, whereas all three above are
  zero-setup and are ordinary syntax people type for non-evasive reasons
  (`cp file.{txt,bak}` is completely normal). "We accept some
  under-detection" is a budget, and it silently overran — the accepted case
  was narrow and these are broad.

- **Why the author didn't find it and the reviewer did.** The author's own
  adversarial sweep (26 dangerous forms) was built from *the mechanism he
  had just fixed* — comments, redirects, line continuations, quoting. Not
  one case used a shell expansion, because expansions were not part of the
  bug he had in mind. A fresh-context reviewer, given only "find any
  remaining bypass," had no such anchor. **Generalize: your own bypass
  hunt is shaped by the bug you just fixed, and is therefore blindest
  exactly where the next bug lives.**

**Fixes, in the order they buy the most:**

1. **Decide explicitly whether you are guarding text or argv, and write it
   down.** If argv, a lexer alone cannot get you there and every expansion
   is an open hole. If text (a reasonable choice for a cheap PreToolUse
   guard), then the accepted-under-detection list must name the expansion
   classes, not just the one you happened to think of.
2. **Normalize the expansions you can, on raw text, outside quotes, before
   tokenizing.** You do not need to *implement* bash expansion — you need
   only to stop the expansion from *hiding a flag*. Rewriting `{a,b}` to
   ` a b `, `$'x'` to `x`, and `${IFS…}` to a space is a few dozen lines and
   restores the flags as independent tokens the existing logic already
   understands. Constrain the brace rule to groups that contain a comma and
   no whitespace, or you will eat `find -exec {} \;` and `awk '{print $1}'`.
3. **Prove the exploit against real bash before you fix, and against real
   bash after.** A guard-parser disagreement is not automatically a
   vulnerability — the reviewer here correctly discarded one candidate
   (`{-a,} -m x`) after finding that real `git` rejects it with `fatal:
   paths … with -a does not make sense`. Dump argv with a probe script that
   just prints `"$@"`; that is the ground truth, not your reading of the
   man page.
4. **Measure the fix against a real corpus, in both directions.** Here:
   27,641 real commands containing `commit` / brace-with-comma / `IFS` /
   `$'`, run through pre-fix and post-fix binaries, **zero exit-code
   differences** — three complete bypasses closed with provably no
   real-world behavior change. Without that number, "I added a normalizer to
   a Tier-0 gate" is an unbounded false-positive risk, and false positives
   on a gate are worse than the gap you closed.
5. **Keep the positive controls that pass in BOTH versions.** The
   calibration run against the pre-fix binary should redden *only* the
   bug-specific cases (here 11 of them: 8 bypasses + 3 false blocks), while
   `cp file.{txt,bak}` and "braces appearing inside a commit message as
   data" stay green on both. A positive control that only passes after the
   fix is not a control — it is another regression test riding along.

## 34. A PostToolUse-only registration never fires on the Bash command's own failure — that lives entirely on a separate PostToolUseFailure event

> Worked example: a PostToolUse hook meant to fire when a `git` query against
> a given path failed with "fatal: not a git repository" (a private hooks
> repo, not shipped here), 2026-08-16. Registered `PostToolUse` only, matcher
> `Bash`. Manually running the exact triggering command produced zero hook
> output — no error, no stderr, nothing.

- **Symptom, and why it's easy to misdiagnose as something else.** The
  natural first two guesses are both wrong and both cost real debugging time:
  "the hook didn't hot-reload after the settings.json edit" (it did — every
  *other* Bash call in the same session was triggering it fine), or "the
  matcher/filter logic is wrong" (it wasn't — the same command text fed to
  the script by hand produced the expected output). What actually
  distinguished the silent case from the working ones was invisible to both
  guesses: the triggering command's own exit code.

- **The actual mechanism, confirmed by live trace comparison.** Claude Code
  routes a Bash tool call's outcome to one of two *separate* hook events
  based on the command's own exit code — not to `PostToolUse` unconditionally
  with a status field inside it. Exit `0` routes to `PostToolUse`. Any
  nonzero exit (128 for `git`'s "fatal: not a git repository", but this is
  general, not specific to that exit code) routes instead to a distinct
  `PostToolUseFailure` event, and `PostToolUse` does not fire for that same
  invocation at all. A hook registered under `PostToolUse` only is
  structurally blind to every failing command it was likely written to
  catch — command failure is usually exactly the case worth reacting to.
  This was confirmed by comparing a debug trace log across two command
  runs in the same session: every exit-0 command in the window was logged
  by the hook, including one from a concurrent session; the one exit-128
  command was not logged at all, with `PostToolUse` as the sole
  registration. This is not currently documented in this skill bundle as of
  2026-08-16 — treat it as a platform behavior to verify against your own
  CLI version rather than a permanent guarantee.

- **Fix.**
  1. **Register the SAME hook command under both events** in `settings.json`
     — one `PostToolUse` entry and one `PostToolUseFailure` entry, both with
     matcher `Bash`, both pointing at the identical script path. Without the
     second registration, the failure path is simply never invoked, no
     matter how correct the script's internal logic is.
  2. **Read `hook_event_name` from the input JSON and echo it back verbatim**
     in `hookSpecificOutput.hookEventName`, rather than hardcoding one value.
     Whether the CLI validates that field against the event that actually
     fired is not something to bet on either way — echoing the real value
     back is strictly safer than guessing.
  3. **Write end-to-end test fixtures for both event shapes.** A fixture
     that only feeds the script a `PostToolUse`-shaped JSON payload can never
     exercise the failure path, even if the script's logic branches on
     `hook_event_name` — the branch exists in the code but never runs in the
     suite. Include at least one fixture with `"hook_event_name":
     "PostToolUseFailure"` in the input.
  4. **When debugging "the hook isn't firing" for a case involving a failing
     command, check the triggering command's own exit code before anything
     else.** If it's nonzero and the hook is registered under `PostToolUse`
     only, that fully explains the silence — it is not a hot-reload problem,
     not a matcher problem, and no amount of re-editing the matching logic
     will fix it.

## 35. A pipeline's exit status is its last segment's — a `cmd | head || echo "无"` fallback is dead code, and its empty output cannot tell "none" from "died"

> Worked example: `pipe-fallback-guard.sh` (a private hooks repo, not
> shipped here) — shipped 2026-08-15 after the prose rule (which already
> named this exact shape) was violated four times in one session, and it
> caught its first real `grep … | tail || echo` on 2026-08-18. One of the

- **Symptom:** an existence probe prints nothing and its `|| echo "无"`
  fallback never fires — not once, ever. You are left reading an empty
  result that is byte-identical across two opposite worlds: "the command
  ran and found nothing" and "the command never ran (permission / path /
  network / `fatal`)". Anything you conclude from that emptiness is a
  guess.

- **Cause — `||` binds to the pipeline's last segment, not to the
  pipeline.** A pipeline's exit status is the exit status of its **last
  command**, and this one root cause breaks the fallback in **both
  directions**:
  - **Dead fallback (what the guard blocks):** `head` / `tail` / `wc` /
    `cat` / `sort` exit 0 on empty input, so `find … | head -5 || echo "无"`
    asks "did `head` succeed" — always yes — and the fallback is
    unreachable code. The upstream command's death is swallowed before
    anyone looks at it.
  - **Lying fallback (the 2026-08-15 near-miss):** `grep` on empty input
    exits 1, so `cmd | grep x || echo "已删"` **does** fire — but it fires
    identically for "upstream died" and "genuinely no match", because
    grep's input is empty in both worlds. The fallback is live and still
    wrong. For `find` / `grep -l` the trap is stacked two deep even without
    a pipe: zero matches is itself a *legitimate* answer (exit 0, no
    output), so the fallback was never going to fire on the healthy-empty
    case — its only possible job was catching real failure, and that is
    exactly the job emptiness cannot do.

- **The `&&`-chain sibling is semantically fine — audit the last segment,
  not the shape.** `A && B || C` parses as `(A && B) || C`; the `||` fires
  when the chain's last executed command fails, which is what a fallback
  wants, and no exit code is swallowed — *unless* `B` is itself a pipeline
  ending in an always-0 segment, in which case the dead fallback is back.
  (The classic caveat applies either way: `A && B || C` is not "if A then B
  else C" — `C` also runs when `A` succeeds and `B` fails. For a fallback
  that is usually the intent; if `C` assumes `A`'s side effects, it isn't.)
  Scope note: the zsh `echo ===` EQUALS expansion — a bare `=`-leading word
  aborting the *rest of the script* — is a different failure on a different
  axis and is deliberately not this entry; it shipped as its own guard
  (`zsh-equals-guard.sh`, 2026-08-18).

- **Why this is a hook and not the prose rule that already existed.** The
  rule was written down, with this exact shape named, and was still
  violated four times in one session (2026-08-15) — one of them a
  deliverable away from a false fact. Prose is advice; a wall is a wall.
  This entry joins the #10/#15/#33 family — the shell fact that bites you
  is never visible in the text you typed — on the exit-status axis rather
  than the parsing axis.

- **Why `pipefail` is not the default cure (measured, so don't re-argue
  it):** it convicts two healthy commands — `seq 1 300000 | head -1`
  returns **141** (SIGPIPE on a deliberately truncated pipe is normal
  usage), and `grep -c zzz` returns **1** when zero hits is the legitimate
  answer. A gate that fails healthy input trains reflexive bypass —
  pitfall #2's rule, applied to a shell builtin. Hence the guard's escape
  hatch is not a flag but the correct form itself: a command already
  containing `pipefail` / `PIPESTATUS` / `pipestatus` is treated as "the
  author knows" and passes. Shellcheck is measured-and-rejected as the
  gate: its default config does not report `find . | head -5 || echo 无`
  at all (0.11.0, exit 0), and `--enable=all`'s SC2312 fires on the
  *legal* `cmd | jq . || echo bad` too — it knows pipes can mask returns,
  not which last segments swallow codes. (It also lints script files, not
  tool-call events, so it could never be this hook anyway.)

**Fixes, in the order they buy the most:**

1. **Judge success by the exit code, never by output emptiness — drop the
   pipe first.** `cmd > /tmp/out 2>&1; ec=$?` makes the two worlds
   distinguishable by construction: `ec` tells you "ran" vs "died", and
   the log is read only after `ec=0`. It also fixes the lying-fallback
   direction, which no last-segment blocklist can.
2. **If the pipe must stay, read the first segment's real code:**
   `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (bash) / `$pipestatus[1]` (zsh) — captured
   immediately, before any intervening command rewrites it. (Pitfall #8
   carries the sibling trap for `$(…)`: the `||` goes *outside* the
   substitution — `X=$(cmd | wc -l) || X='?'` — or `wc` prints `0` into
   your fallback value.)
3. **For existence probes, make "ran and found none" a different
   observable from "didn't run".** Count the results, or branch on `ec` —
   but never let a bare empty stdout be the evidence. A marker like
   `|| echo "<name>: 无"` only rescues the no-pipe case; inside a pipeline
   it is dead on arrival.
4. **If you guard this with a hook, precision is the entire product.**
   Block only the provably-dead shape — last pipeline segment in a named
   swallow-list **and** a trailing `||` — and let `cmd | jq . || …` pass,
   because `jq` really can fail and the `||` is live. The block message
   should teach the fix forms from items 1–2 verbatim; the harness rows
   must pin both directions (the `| head ||` case exits 2, the `| jq ||`
   case exits 0), or you have shipped a false-block machine against
   everyday, healthy shell.

## 36. A self-applied review rule can loop without any hook

- **Symptom:** an agent runs independent review, applies the findings, then
  automatically launches another fresh reviewer because the fix was
  substantive. The next reviewer finds a new issue, often outside the original
  axis, so the agent fixes that too and launches another. Each round is locally
  justified; the user experiences an expanding task that never returns to the
  original objective.
- **Cause:** the process has T and R but no immutable **loop key**, no fixed
  failure axis, and no cycle budget. “Any substantive edit needs review” makes
  every remediation mint a fresh trigger. Unrelated findings silently reset the
  scope, so even a converging review of one artifact becomes an unbounded stream
  of newly admitted work. There may be no shell hook at all — prose plus the
  agent's completion drive is enough to create the feedback loop.
- **Why a termination proof alone is insufficient.** One measured low-stakes,
  single-reader correction used three full independent-review rounds (~253K
  tokens). The third round found nothing, so V genuinely reached zero. But the
  round-2 correction had already been checked against the primary source, and
  the remaining consequence was a reader noticing a typo. “It terminates” and
  “the next cycle is worth running” are different claims.
- **Scale removes the safety net self-termination looked like.** The same shape
  recurred the same day at roughly seven times that scale, on a fact-check
  report meant to inform a real decision rather than a proofread: 21 completed
  independent-review rounds plus a 22nd already dispatched, stopped only when a
  human asked why — nothing in the process paused it on its own. Each round
  re-ran one fixed, multi-question reader-spec against the *whole* document
  rather than against what the previous fix had actually touched, so even a
  change confined to wording or disclosure could still trip a finding on an
  unrelated axis; the loop key was never narrowed to the edit's own axis,
  exactly the gap this pitfall's Fix prescribes closing. Real defects did
  surface across those rounds — the review was not worthless — so the missing
  check was never “is this finding real,” it was “does clearing it still
  justify a fresh pass over everything else.”
- **A formal "ready to ship" gate is not immune either — the lineage can reopen
  after passing it.** A different fact-check report, also meant to inform a
  real personal decision: 19 independent-review rounds, **three** of which
  also triggered a separate formal acceptance pass — a workflow's own
  designated "0 open findings, ready to ship" checkpoint, not merely another
  review — at round 10, round 15, and round 19, spanning three calendar days.
  The first acceptance passed the
  same day as round 10. The lineage still reopened roughly two days later and
  ran five more rounds before a second acceptance (round 15) — which *also*
  did not end the task; four more rounds followed before the third acceptance
  actually shipped it. Termination held every time (each acceptance genuinely
  found the artifact ready when it ran); every new finding across those rounds
  was real and on a different axis, so no single round was the "same-axis
  BLOCKER" this pitfall's Fix already says should stop a reopen. The signal
  that would have caught it is a different one: **a lineage that has already
  cleared its own ready-to-ship gate once and is still running is itself the
  thing to surface** — independent of whether the new round's finding is
  same-axis or genuinely fresh — which is the trip condition the Fix below
  adds.
- **Fix:** write the Loop Contract from SKILL.md rule 7 before round 1. Key it on
  one immutable lineage plus one failure axis; predeclare the budget and both
  exits. Repair commits and new reviewer names remain in that lineage. For
  agent-driven review loops, the default is one initial review plus one narrowly
  scoped re-review after substantive fixes. A new, unrelated finding becomes a
  backlog item / new task; it does not reset the budget. If the re-review still
  reproduces a same-axis BLOCKER or MAJOR, stop with the artifact unregistered
  or unshipped and report `blocked` — do not silently dispatch a third reviewer.
  **A same-axis recurrence is not the only trip condition worth coding for**:
  if the lineage has already passed one formal acceptance/ready-to-ship check
  and a new round is about to run anyway, that crossing — by itself, before
  judging whether the new finding is real — is the signal to stop and put the
  question to the human, not to reason "this one's a genuinely new finding, so
  it's fine." A second "ready to ship" should not be quieter than the first.
- **Restart authority:** only an explicitly user-authorized new task can open
  another review budget after the cap. The agent must then declare that budget,
  the concrete safety or business failure caused by stopping, and the new
  falsifying experiment before cycle 1. Declaring those fields is necessary but
  cannot authorize the agent's own restart. “A reviewer found something” and
  optional polish are not enough.
- **Honest enforcement boundary:** nothing in Claude Code mechanically enforces
  a hookless review budget. This remains an agent-executed contract. Its safety
  comes from the predeclared cap and visible capped exit, not from pretending a
  reminder is a hard gate. **When a hook is built to close that gap** (see
  pitfall 37), the hook's own detection vocabulary needs the same real-prompt
  calibration as any other pattern-matcher — building the mechanism does not
  retire the need to verify it fires on what agents actually type.

## 37. A keyword-whitelist review-loop guard, once built, still needs calibrating against the phrasing its own author actually types — not the phrasing it was designed around

- **Symptom:** `review-loop-budget-guard.sh` (the PreToolUse hook pitfall 36
  names as the fix for its own nothing-mechanically-enforces-this gap — a
  real mechanization, not vaporware) never fired once in a session where the
  same artifact (`probe_writer_liveness.py`)
  received three separate independent-review Agent dispatches back to back,
  exactly the pattern it exists to catch. The user twice told the agent to
  stop dispatching more reviews (correct — the agent complied and self-fixed
  the remaining findings directly) before separately asking, in a later turn,
  *why the review loop kept happening at all and whether the mechanized guard
  had ever actually covered this case* — a question the prose-discipline
  compliance in the moment could not have answered, because the loop's root
  cause was not agent judgment but the guard silently never firing.
- **Cause:** the guard's marker check was a fixed phrase list — literal
  substrings `"independent review"`, `"independent reviewer"`,
  `"independent acceptance"`. But the actual dispatch prompts, written by the
  same agent following **this very skill-creator's discipline 5** ("an
  independent, fresh-context adversarial pass"), read "an **independent
  adversarial** review", "an independent, **READ-ONLY adversarial code**
  review" — discipline 5's own canonical phrasing inserts one or more
  methodology adjectives between "independent" and the terminal noun. A
  substring check requires the two words to be exactly adjacent, so it exits
  before the per-lineage counter is even touched. Replaying the real session's
  transcript (`grep`-extracting the three actual Agent `tool_input.prompt`
  values, not reconstructing them from memory) showed the damage precisely:
  of 5 genuine independent-review dispatches across two artifacts that
  session, **4 were invisible to the guard**, including the exact 3rd
  dispatch on the same key that should have crossed `BUDGET=2` — only one
  dispatch happened to phrase it as the literal, unmodified "independent
  review" and got counted.
- **Rule 9's own worked example is the mirror image of this one, and the gap
  it names is exactly the gap here.** Rule 9's finding was a *false-positive*
  incident — a guard's 26-case hand-written table looked thorough and still
  had a ~22% wrong-block rate against a real 11,903-command replay, "because
  you wrote its inputs from the same mental model that produced the
  detector." This pitfall is that sentence's *false-negative* sibling: the
  five hand-written `--selftest` fixtures this guard shipped with (`p_a`/`p_b`
  and friends) were also written from the same mental model that produced the
  marker list, so they could not have caught a phrasing the author hadn't
  thought to test — which is exactly what a later, real session then typed.
  Rule 9's four-step method (harvest real transcripts → pre-filter with the
  shipped detector, sliced out verbatim → feed real inputs to the real hook →
  hand-check the disagreements) is direction-agnostic despite its own example
  being about over-blocking; running it here would have surfaced this
  under-triggering just as reliably. Skill-creator's own discipline 6 names
  the general form — calibrate a check against real, known material before
  trusting it — and separately warns that the frustration of hitting the same
  trap repeatedly is itself the state in which a miscalibrated defense gets
  shipped, which is a fair description of the session that first wrote this
  guard in the small hours, right after a real recurrence of pitfall 36's
  mixcut incident (see this guard's own file header).
- **Fix:** replace the rigid three-phrase "independent ..." family with a
  regex requiring `independent` followed by 0–3 words from a **closed set of
  review-methodology adjectives** (`fresh-context`, `fresh`, `read-only`,
  `adversarial`, `thorough`, `rigorous`, `unbiased`, `blind`, `critical`,
  `code`, `second`, `skeptical`, `outside`) and then one of
  `review|reviewer|acceptance|pass`. The closed set is load-bearing, not
  incidental — an open "any word(s) between independent and review" pattern
  (tried first) false-positived on 4 of 6 adversarial negative probes in
  under a minute of testing ("independent contractor review", "independent
  so a future review", "independent before you review", "independent
  variable review board"), reproducing exactly the "misfires on healthy
  input" failure mode this same file's rule 1 warns is worse than the
  original miss. The literal Chinese/English phrase list for the *other*
  marker families (`独立审阅`, `reader-review`, `fresh reviewer`, …) was left
  untouched — there was no evidence they were broken, and widening scope past
  the diagnosed bug would itself violate the calibrate-before-arm discipline.
- **The fix's own first calibration pass was itself under-calibrated —
  caught only by pointing the same discipline at the fix.** The independent
  reviewer dispatched against this exact diff was told to execute the shipped
  regex directly (not read it and guess), and did: `second`, `skeptical`, and
  `outside` — plain, plausible review-methodology words — all returned
  `False` against the first-shipped adjective set. This is the pitfall's own
  lesson recurring one level up: a closed set calibrated against the author's
  own guess at "what a real reviewer says" is still a guess, just a narrower
  one, and the fix for that is the same as the fix for the original bug —
  run the detector against inputs an adversarial party actually constructs,
  not inputs the author pre-approved. The three words are now in the set
  above; two more `--selftest` cases (8 and 9) exercise them through the real
  call path — a positive combining two of the new words in one prompt, and a
  negative built from the exact grammatical shape (`independent of the
  second X`, `outside temperature`) that would make a naive keyword-only
  check misfire if the words were added carelessly.
- **Verification, in order of strength:** (1) 6 real/plausible positive
  phrases and 8 adversarial negative phrases, hand-constructed, all correct;
  (2) four `--selftest` cases checked into the guard (two from the initial
  fix, two more — see above — from the fix's own independent review), so the
  regression is enforced mechanically, not just asserted in this prose; (3)
  **the strongest check — replaying the three byte-for-byte real prompts
  extracted from the actual incident's session transcript** through the
  fixed hook: dispatch 1 and 2 silent, dispatch 3 correctly produces the full
  `additionalContext` budget warning with the correct extracted key,
  independently re-derived (not just re-read) by the same reviewer parsing
  the raw transcript itself. A synthetic reconstruction of "what I probably
  wrote" would not have caught the exact insertion pattern, and would not
  have caught the second-round gap either; only real, adversarially-supplied
  input catches a blind spot the author cannot see from inside their own
  guess.
- **Generalizes to every keyword/phrase-based hook in this skill, not just
  this one:** a marker list is a claim about how agents phrase things, and
  that claim goes stale the moment the *teaching material* (a skill, a
  discipline, a style guide) changes its own recommended wording — which is
  exactly what happened here, since discipline 5's phrasing predates or
  postdates the guard's marker list without either side knowing about the
  other. When a hook's trigger condition is "does the prompt contain phrase
  X", periodically re-derive X from what agents are actually instructed to
  write, not from what seemed reasonable when the hook was first built.

---

## 38. A hook reading an env var its host never sets is a no-op indistinguishable from a healthy skip

- **Symptom:** the hook is registered, `bash -n` is clean, it is `chmod +x`, and
  it never once injects. Nothing errors. For an injecting hook (UserPromptSubmit,
  PostToolUse) that state is **identical** to the healthy case — "I looked at this
  prompt and it wasn't relevant, exit 0, no output" — so there is no observable
  that separates them. Measured: PKM's `people-roster-reminder.sh` ran this way
  from 2026-07-04 to 2026-08-28; across 542 session transcripts its
  `attachment.type == "hook_success"` count was **zero** for the whole period.
- **Cause:** the script took the prompt from an environment variable —
  `PROMPT="${USER_PROMPT_TEXT:-}"` — that Claude Code does not set. The
  UserPromptSubmit contract delivers the prompt **only** in the stdin JSON's
  `.prompt` field (event contract: `hook_patterns.md`). The variable was empty on
  every invocation, so the next line, `[ -z "$PROMPT" ] && exit 0`, returned
  before any logic ran.
- **How it survived two months, which is the part worth copying:** it was exposed
  by an *unrelated* second bug — a relative registration path (#39) that started
  printing `No such file or directory` once the user happened to launch `claude`
  from a subdirectory. Had the path been written correctly on day one, the silent
  no-op had no remaining route to visibility. **A hook whose failure mode is
  silence gets found by accident or not at all.**
- **The near-miss in its own creation, from the session transcript:** `Write` →
  `chmod +x` → `grep -r 'workshop-skill-loader|UserPromptSubmit' ~/.claude/settings.json`
  → `Edit` settings.json → `git commit`. The script was **never executed once**
  before being registered and committed. Note the grep: the author *did* consult a
  working hook of the same event type — but asked it "how is this registered in
  settings.json", not "how does this script obtain the prompt". The correct answer
  (`json.load(sys.stdin).get('prompt','')`, used by all four other UserPromptSubmit
  hooks on that machine) was one question away.
- **Fix:** read the prompt from stdin, per the event contract:
  ```bash
  INPUT=$(cat)
  PROMPT=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "
  import sys, json
  try:    print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('prompt', ''))
  except Exception: print('')
  " 2>/dev/null || echo "")
  ```
  Then close the observability hole rather than trusting the next author to read
  this entry: run the real JSON through it before registering (rule 2), and give
  it bidirectional editing/maintenance selftests. Use only an owner-declared
  bounded offline `--liveness` mode at SessionStart (build order step 4); without
  one, retain unknown/incomplete logic coverage instead of running the selftest
  battery at startup. A `--selftest` that has never been watched failing
  proves nothing — calibrate it by injecting this exact defect (swap stdin parsing
  back for the env var) and confirming the must-fire fixture goes red.

---

## 39. A project-level hook registered with a relative path dies on any cwd change — and nothing was checking project-level hooks at all

- **Symptom:** `UserPromptSubmit hook error / Failed with non-blocking status
  code: /bin/sh: .claude/hooks/<name>.sh: No such file or directory` — while the
  file plainly exists, is executable, and runs fine when you test it by hand from
  the repo root.
- **Cause:** the repo's own `.claude/settings.json` registered the hook as
  `".claude/hooks/<name>.sh"`. `/bin/sh -c` resolves that against the **session's
  cwd**, which is wherever `claude` was started — not the project root.
- **The timeline is the tell, and it is not what it looks like.** Registered
  2026-07-04; first error 2026-08-17. Nothing regressed that day: every session
  between those dates had been started from the repo root, where the relative path
  happens to resolve. 8/17 was simply the first launch from a subdirectory. A
  second, genuine change followed at v2.1.247 (2026-08-27), after which the repo
  root failed too — observed across three versions, mechanism not established, and
  not worth establishing since the fix is invariant to it.
- **The second failure, and the larger one:** none of this was visible to the
  guard-rail health check, because that check walks `~/.claude/hooks/*.sh` only.
  A hook registered in a repo's own `.claude/settings.json` had **no** coverage —
  not its syntax, not its path, not its `--selftest`. Two independent silent
  failures (#38 and this one) lived in the same file for two months inside a setup
  that runs a SessionStart health check specifically to prevent that.
- **Fix:** absolute path in the registration. Do **not** dress a relative path up
  as `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-/abs/fallback}/…` and call it belt-and-braces: the
  fallback only covers "variable unset", not "variable set to something other than
  the repo root", and you cannot observe which case you are in from inside the
  hook. On a single-machine personal repo, the literal absolute path has zero
  unknowns.
  Then extend the health check to the project layer — cwd from the SessionStart
  event JSON (never assumed; assuming it is this very bug), walking up for
  `.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json`, excluding `~/.claude` which
  the profile-registration section already owns:
  ```python
  tok = shlex.split(cmd)[0]
  if "/" in tok and not tok.startswith(("/", "~", "$")):
      problem("RELATIVE hook path in %s: %r — /bin/sh resolves it against the "
              "session cwd" % (label, tok))
  ```
  and per target: exists, executable, `bash -n`, `--selftest`. Prove the event
  channel is actually being read rather than a `$PWD` fallback quietly carrying
  the tests: run it once with the shell cwd somewhere harmless and the event cwd
  pointing at a broken config (must warn), then the reverse (must stay silent).
  Both directions, or a dead event channel reads as a green suite.

---

## 40. A bare backtick inside an unquoted heredoc executes the line and eats the paragraph

- **Symptom:** an injecting hook's message comes out with one passage missing, and
  stderr carries something like `line 33: -: command not found`. The exit code is
  still 0 and every exit-code assertion still passes.
- **Cause:** `cat <<EOF` (delimiter unquoted) performs command substitution inside
  the body. Prose written for a human reader is full of markdown backticks;
  each pair becomes a command. Measured: a line reading
  `` 身份、关系和 **ASR 变体标注**（`- **ASR 变体**: ...`）全在里面。`` printed as
  `（）` with `-: command not found` on stderr — the shell ran `- **ASR 变体**: ...`
  and substituted its (empty) output. A second backtick pair in the same body,
  around a file path, produced `…/people.md: Permission denied`.
- **Not the same as #9,** which is a quote or backtick inside a `python3 -c "…"`
  block. This one needs no embedded language: plain shell, plain heredoc, and the
  damage is to the *message*, which is the hook's entire product.
- **Fix:** quote the delimiter — `cat <<'EOF'` — and drop the now-unnecessary
  backslash escapes inside. Test it where exit codes cannot reach: assert
  **stderr is empty** and assert the rendered body **contains a substring from
  after the first backtick**. Both, and both polarities:
  ```bash
  err=$(mktemp); out=$(printf '%s' "$HIT" | bash "$SELF" 2>"$err")
  [ -z "$(cat "$err")" ] || fail "stderr non-empty (unquoted heredoc)"
  case "$out" in *'ASR 变体**: ...'*) ;; *) fail "body truncated at the backtick" ;; esac
  ```
  An exit-code-only suite is structurally blind here — see the `says` rows in
  `scripts/test_hook.sh`, and the general statement of this gap in #14.

---

## 41. `stat -f` reports the symlink, not the file — an mtime-keyed state stamp goes blind to every SSOT edit

- **Symptom:** a scheduler built around "re-run the expensive check whenever this
  file changes" runs the expensive check exactly once, then never again. It looks
  like it is working: the cheap path runs, the stamp file exists, nothing warns.
- **Cause:** BSD `stat -f '%m %z'` does **not** follow symlinks — it reports the
  link's own mtime (when the link was made) and size (the length of the target
  path string). In the symlink installation layout described by rule 3,
  `~/.claude/hooks/` points into a version-controlled SSOT. These choices compose into a
  guaranteed defect: editing the SSOT leaves the link untouched, the signature
  never moves, and the full battery never re-fires. Measured: the stamp held
  `1787620496 61` — a 61-byte "file" that is really the target path string, and
  an mtime from when the link was made — while the SSOT it points at was
  `1787920666 27010`.
- **Fix:** `stat -L -f '%m %z'` on BSD/macOS, `stat -L -c '%Y %s'` on GNU. The
  same `-L` applies anywhere this skill suggests keying state on mtime (the
  hysteresis stamp in rule 7's mechanism 4 among them). And the regression test
  has to exercise the link: a case that **edits the SSOT without touching the
  symlink** and asserts the expensive path fires. A suite that stats a real file
  passes with `-L` missing, which is why the bug shipped in the first cut.
- **Sibling:** #42 is the same root (rule 3's symlink, left unresolved) with a
  different victim — that one **locates** a sibling file from the link's directory
  instead of stat-ing the link. When you fix either, grep the hook for every other
  use of its own path.

## 42. A symlinked hook that locates a sibling file with `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` looks in the wrong directory — and the miss is reported as "selftest failed"

- **Symptom:** the hook's `--selftest` passes when you run it by its SSOT path, and
  the SessionStart health check reports `selftest failed: <hook>` for the same file
  on every session. Nothing else is wrong: `bash -n` is clean, the detector blocks
  and allows correctly, the registration is present. Only the health check disagrees,
  and only ever in one direction.
- **Precondition (or you will not see this at all):** the selected check must
  exercise the sibling lookup. Pattern C's compact syntax/registration scan
  does not. SKILL.md's **build order step 4** keeps editing/maintenance selftests
  separate from owner-declared offline startup liveness; exercise each supported
  mode through its registered path. A syntax-only scan leaves sibling lookup
  unverified; it is not a reason to run the full battery at startup.
- **Cause:** the same choices as #41, composing through a different
  mechanism. In rule 3's symlink layout, `~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh` links into the
  SSOT; that build-order health check invokes hooks by that path. `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` is the path
  bash was **invoked with**, not the resolved file — so inside the hook
  `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` is `~/.claude/hooks`, and a sibling lookup such as
  `exec bash "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/<name>.test.sh"` finds nothing and exits
  **127**. To the health check 127 is simply non-zero, so a fully healthy guard is
  advertised as broken at every session start — which is the expensive direction:
  a permanent false alarm trains the operator to ignore that whole line of output.
  Where #41 **stats** the link instead of the target, this one **locates from** it.
  Anything that resolves a path out of `$0`/`BASH_SOURCE` is in this family:
  a bundled library it sources, a fixture directory, a template.
- **Fix:** walk the link chain before taking `dirname`. What you need is *resolve
  every hop, then take the directory* — name the behavior rather than a flag, because
  the flag's availability is exactly the thing that varies. `readlink -f` does it in
  one call and **current macOS does ship it** (verified on Darwin 25.5: `/usr/bin/readlink`
  is a real BSD binary and `-f` resolves a two-hop chain), but it is not in POSIX and
  older BSDs omit it, and a hook runs on whatever machine installed it. The loop below
  depends on no flag at all:
  ```bash
  _self="${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"
  while [ -L "$_self" ]; do
    _link=$(readlink "$_self")
    case "$_link" in
      /*) _self="$_link" ;;                          # absolute target
      *)  _self="$(dirname "$_self")/$_link" ;;      # relative to the link's dir
    esac
  done
  _dir=$(cd "$(dirname "$_self")" && pwd)
  ```
- **The calibration that catches it, and the reason it shipped:** the author tests
  the hook the way the author invokes it — by the SSOT path, where `dirname` is
  accidentally right. **During editing/maintenance, run the selftest through the registered path too**
  (`bash ~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh --selftest-full`), because that is the path the
  maintenance harness will use. Startup follows build order step 4's declared
  offline liveness contract. The general form: a hook reached through more than one path is a
  hook that must be exercised through each of them. Same lesson as #41's
  "the regression test has to exercise the link".
- **Diagnosing it from the outside** (you see only `selftest failed`): run the two
  paths side by side and compare — identical output means the fault is real, an
  exit 127 from the registered path means it is this pitfall.

## 43. `settings.json` hook paths come in three spellings, and a consumer that expands only `~` silently rates live guards "unreadable"

- **Symptom:** an auditor, health check, or migration script that iterates the
  **registered** hooks reports a subset as unreadable / unauditable / not found, and
  therefore skips them. Those hooks are live and firing. The report is not empty and
  not obviously wrong — it just quietly has a hole with a plausible-looking label.
- **Cause:** a hook's `command` is a shell-ish string, and real settings files mix
  spellings, because they accumulate over months from different sessions and
  installers. One active profile, measured 2026-08-30: **45** entries as
  `~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh`, **8** fully absolute, **5** as
  `$HOME/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh`. All three fire (verified live in both the `~` and
  the `$HOME` form). Python's `os.path.expanduser` resolves `~` and passes absolute
  paths through, but leaves `$HOME` **literal**; the path then fails `[ -r ]` /
  `os.path.exists` and the consumer files it under "can't check this one". The tool
  that surfaced this enumerates `PreToolUse` only (the one event where `exit 2` has
  blocking semantics), and **4 of those 5 `$HOME`-spelled entries are `PreToolUse`** —
  so four registered blocking guards had never actually been audited by it, which is
  exactly the population it existed to cover. Quote the scope with the count, or the
  two numbers look like they should match and don't.
- **Direction:** one-way and silent. It never rates a broken guard healthy; it rates
  **healthy guards unknown** — and "unknown" in an audit output reads as noise, so
  nobody chases it. A checker with a blind spot is worse than a missing checker,
  because its green covers the gap.
- **Fix:** expand both, in either language.
  ```python
  p = os.path.expanduser(os.path.expandvars(cmd.split()[0]))   # $HOME then ~
  ```
  ```bash
  p="${cmd%% *}"; p="${p/#\$HOME/$HOME}"; p="${p/#\~/$HOME}"   # no eval — the
  # command string is config data, and `eval` on it turns a settings file into
  # code execution
  ```
- **Calibration (the check that would have caught it in one line):** before trusting
  any sweep over registered hooks, assert **targets found == entries registered**.
  A sweep that silently drops 5 of 58 is indistinguishable from one that covers
  everything, unless you compare the two counts. Same instrument discipline as
  rule 9's "a replay returning zero blocks makes the harness a suspect".

## 44. A confirmation dialog can only be as informed as the hook that raises it — an empty one trains rubber-stamping

- **Symptom:** a human gate that used to be useful starts interrupting constantly,
  and the person answering it says they have nothing to decide from. The audit log
  agrees: approvals land within a few seconds, declines are about as frequent as
  approvals, and the dialog body — if you capture it — lists no objects at all. Every
  exit-code row in the suite is green.
- **Cause:** the gate was given a new trigger, and the new trigger reused the dialog
  body built for the old one. That body's only source of content is state the hook
  reads **before the command runs** — a `PreToolUse` hook sees the staged set, the
  working tree, the target as they are *now*. Under the old trigger that state was
  non-empty by definition (the gate fired *because* it had found several things).
  Under the new one — "this single command both creates the state and consumes it",
  e.g. a staging step and a commit chained in one call — the pre-command state is
  empty by construction, so the dialog is too. The hook escalated to a human on
  exactly the path where it had nothing to show them. A person cannot out-know the
  hook from inside its own dialog: they see strictly less than it does, often not
  even the command or which repository. What comes back is not a decision. It is a
  reflexive Allow — the rubber-stamp habit that costs more than a miss — or a Decline,
  which the hook then reports to the model as "a human said no, stop and ask why"
  when no human judged anything.
- **Fix — escalate only where the dialog can carry a decision; elsewhere block
  mechanically.** For each path that reaches the confirm channel, ask what the dialog
  will contain *on that path*. If the hook cannot name the target, the command and
  the objects at stake, do not ask a human: `exit 2` yourself, and make `stderr` say
  three things — this is a mechanical block and **nobody was asked or refused**; do
  not retry unchanged; and the restructured shape that makes the state observable
  (split the creating step and the consuming step into separate tool calls, so the
  next `PreToolUse` event sees the real state and the ordinary rule can judge it —
  passing silently when it is fine, raising an informed dialog when it is not). Say
  outright that the restructuring is the prescribed remedy and not a bypass, or a
  model trained on "a refusal is a hard NO" will stop instead of fixing the command.
  In the guard's audit file — where it logs every prompt and bypass — give that
  path a label of its own: it is neither a human decision nor a "dialog shown,
  nobody answered", and lumping it in with either hides how often the gate blocks.
- **On the paths that keep the dialog, put the decision in it:** which repository or
  target the hook actually read — labelled as *what the hook read*, not as "the
  target", because a path parsed from command text can resolve somewhere else (#28,
  #33) and the human clicks on that sentence; the command text; the object list; and
  an "Allow means…" line that is true on this path (an "every file listed above"
  promise is false when the command will add more after the click).
- **Everything model-authored that the dialog displays is an injection surface.** The
  command text and any path inside it are written by the model. Fold all whitespace
  to single spaces **before** display — otherwise a directory name or argument
  containing a newline starts fresh lines that are typographically indistinguishable
  from the gate's own output ("repository: /safe/place", "only one area, fine to
  allow"). Run every model-authored string through one shared helper: two hand-rolled
  copies is how one string gets folded and the other does not. Truncate by
  characters, not bytes, and state how much was cut; strip invalid UTF-8 — a dialog
  binary handed a split multibyte sequence may refuse to render at all, and a gate
  whose dialog never appears has only a "no" channel left.
- **Calibration — exit codes cannot see any of this (#14).** Point the dialog binary
  at a recorder stub that writes its `argv` to a file, drive every trigger path, and
  **read what a human would have seen**. Then pin it. The no-content path asserts the
  recorder was **never invoked** — a stub that merely fails is indistinguishable, by
  exit code, from a channel that was never called — and an informed path asserts the
  recorder *was* invoked, so the probe is known to be alive. Informed paths assert
  target, command and objects by **line-anchored** match rather than substring: a
  forged line contains the same substring, which is exactly how a fold-less version
  sails through a green suite. Mutate each property (restore the dialog on the empty
  path, drop the context lines, remove each fold) and confirm its own rows die.
- **Real case:** a cross-area commit gate gained a "staging and commit chained in one
  call ⇒ scope unknown ⇒ confirm" rule. Its calibration was thorough on the axis it
  measured — recall and false positives over a six-figure command corpus, with a
  mutation-tested "every exit 2 carries a reason" row — and said nothing about dialog
  content. In the first fifteen hours 38 dialogs reached a person, **36 of them
  listing zero files**, most approvals landing within a few seconds. The repair
  changed no predicate: empty pre-command state now blocks with the split-calls
  remedy and never opens a dialog; the remaining dialogs gained the read-repository
  line, the command and a truthful Allow sentence. An independent review of that
  repair then found the newly added repository line unfolded — a directory name with
  embedded newlines forged three gate-looking lines — while the suite stood at
  154/154, because every content assertion was a substring match.

---

## 45. The remedy a gate prints is its whole product on that path — and it has to survive the gate's *own* parser

- **Symptom:** a blocking hook intercepts, `stderr` says "do X, then retry", the model
  does exactly X, and the next attempt is blocked on identical grounds. Repeat until a
  human interrupts. Nothing errors: the exit code is 2 every time, the audit file has
  every row, the suite is green. From inside the session it reads as a model that will
  not comply. The instruction was never executable.
- **Cause:** what the hook writes to `stderr` **is** the interception — that text is
  the entire yield of blocking, exactly as #44's dialog body is the entire yield of
  escalating to a human. Two ways it comes out unexecutable, and neither is visible to
  an exit-code row:
  - **The string was built for a reader, not for a paste buffer.** A list rendered for
    display is lossy by construction (#12), and #44 *requires* that loss on any
    model-authored text: fold whitespace to single spaces, replace control characters,
    so the text cannot forge gate-looking lines. Feed one of those folded paths back
    into `git add -- <path>` and it is a different pathspec — either git rejects it, or,
    where the bookkeeping is driven by the command text, a claim gets recorded for a
    path that does not exist. The real file stays unclaimed and the next commit is
    blocked the same way. Names containing `[ ] ? *` never clear at all if the
    recording side drops glob-looking candidates, and framework conventions put exactly
    those in ordinary source trees (`app/[id]/page.tsx`).
  - **The self-check was run against the wrong parser.** The natural repair — print a
    pasteable shell literal, then decode it back and compare with the original bytes —
    is worth only as much as the decoder you compare against. Decoding by **bash**
    rules proves bash can read it. But the command the model pastes is read by the
    **gate's** tokenizer, and those are not the same language. Measured on Python's
    `shlex`: `$'a\tb'` (bash ANSI-C quoting) tokenizes to the literal `$a\tb` — the `$`
    kept, the escape never decoded — and `'Foo$Bar.class'` comes back with its `$`
    intact, straight into the "drop any candidate containing `$`" cargo filter that
    #15 prescribes. So a JVM inner-class file pastes fine under bash, really does get
    staged, and is still never recorded: the same loop, now carrying a self-check that
    certifies it. **The error is one line — the self-check measured the wrong frame of
    reference. It asked whether bash could decode the string; the checkpoint the string
    has to clear is the gate's own parser.**
- **Fix — the only test for a printed remedy is to run it and re-run the gate.**
  Assemble the exact bytes the hook emitted into the exact command, execute it, drive
  the same event through the hook again, and assert it now **passes**. "It looks right"
  is not evidence, and "a different parser decodes it" is not evidence either — that is
  the second defect above, stated in its own defence. This is #14 applied to the one
  message a blocking hook exists to produce.
- **One string cannot hold both jobs.** Sanitizing for display and instructing the
  model are different purposes, and a lossy string serves the second badly. Emit, per
  item, a form that is safe to show *and* safe to paste: single-quoted when the path
  carries no control characters (spaces survive verbatim inside the quotes), and the
  escaped `$'…'` form when it does, so no raw control byte reaches `stderr`. Choosing
  per item is what lets both requirements hold at once.
- **Some inputs have no executable remedy — label those and give a route that does
  work.** Where a name cannot clear the gate's tokenizer at all, say so on that line
  and print a different way forward. Do not widen a fail-closed parser to accommodate a
  handful of pathological names: the surface you open is permanent, the population it
  serves is not.
- **Then falsify the label.** A "cannot be pasted" annotation that never fires is the
  same dead probe as a suite that cannot go red (#46) — in the failing version it did
  not trigger on any of ten test names, and that silence was the bug's only visible
  symptom. Assert it appears on a fixture that should carry it, and mutate the
  self-check back to the wrong frame of reference to confirm that row dies.
- **Real case (2026-09-20, a private hooks repository):** a commit-scope gate listed
  unclaimed files and told the model to claim them with `git add -- <paths>`. Across
  four review rounds by a reviewer holding no shared context, the display-string paste
  surfaced first, as a BLOCKER; the repair introduced the bash-frame self-check; a
  later round found that repair still
  looping on `$`-bearing and control-character names — a second BLOCKER. Neither the
  author nor the orchestrator caught either one. Every exit-code row stayed green
  throughout, and the annotation the first repair added never fired once.

---

## 46. A green suite says nothing until every assertion has a mutation that kills it — a dead probe reads exactly like a pass

- **Symptom:** the suite is green, rows keep getting added, and the defect those rows
  were written for ships anyway. The tell appears only when you go looking: break the
  implementation on purpose and **nothing turns red**. There is one correct reading of
  that, and it is not "my mutation must be wrong". The nastier variant does not even
  give you that tell: the rows go red exactly when you break the code — red about a
  branch production never executes.
- **Cause — the assertion never reached the condition it claims to test. Five shapes,
  all of which print the same green:**
  1. **The fixture failed to build, and the failure was swallowed.** A setup step
     errored (`git worktree add` against a repository with no commits), the assertion
     never ran once, and the harness reported the row as passed.
  2. **The fixture built and its precondition still did not hold.** A file was
     rewritten with byte-identical content, so nothing staged, so the staged set never
     spanned two areas, so the cross-area exemption under test was never entered. The
     `exit 0` the row asserted was real and had nothing to do with the exemption; two
     assertions were vacuously true. Note what this shape defeats: a "fail loudly if
     the fixture cannot be built" guard does not catch it, because the fixture built.
  3. **Two fixes stacked, and the later one makes the earlier one's row vacuous.** A
     case covering symlink claims showed zero red under its mutation because a
     different fix — directory expansion — intercepted the input first. It went red
     only after the fixture was rebuilt so the gap under test was the *one* unsatisfied
     condition on that path.
  4. **The rig's own plumbing puts the mutation out of reach.** The calibration script
     sourced the library under test from a hard-coded path, so every assertion that
     called a library function directly kept running against the unmutated copy, no
     matter which copy the rest of the run pointed at.
  5. **A probe omits an argument production always passes, so it has been exercising
     the fallback branch all along.** A library function gained a parameter — the
     repository top level, the frame of reference deciding whether a path can be
     claimed. The **production** call site passed it correctly from the first commit,
     and an upstream default filled it in when empty, so no end-to-end input could
     produce the missing case. What omitted it were the **test's own two probes**:
     every call they made took the "argument absent → fall back to a different frame of
     reference" branch. Those probes were green, and their mutations *did* go red — red
     about the fallback's behaviour, on a path production never reaches. The suite was
     measuring code the product does not run. **The check:** temporarily make the
     missing-argument branch `raise`; every probe that still runs is one that is not on
     the production path. It was not found by reading the code — it surfaced when
     someone asked, as an afterthought, to audit *every* call site of the new
     parameter, at which point production was right and the tests were not. A companion
     finding from that same audit shows how little "the probe happened to agree" is
     worth: the old implementation looked correct when handed a non-existent path, and
     measurement showed that was `os.path.relpath(ap, "")` meeting
     `os.path.abspath("") == os.getcwd()` — run the identical call from another working
     directory and the answer changes.
- **Diagnostic, in one line: all rows green and zero rows red under mutation means the
  assertion is dead.** Suspect the fixture's precondition first and the mutation last —
  shapes 2–4 all present as "I must have mutated the wrong function". **Shape 5 is
  invisible to that diagnostic**, because its rows do die on cue, so it needs the
  separate habit: when a function gains a parameter, do not stop at "does the
  production call site pass it?" — ask "do the **test** call sites pass it?". Omitting
  an argument in a test rarely turns a row red. It quietly relocates the row onto
  another branch.
- **Fix — the invariant is one kill per assertion, not one mutation per assertion.**
  Every row needs some deliberate breakage that reddens it. A single mutation usually
  reddens a group of rows, which is fine *provided* you name the rows it should kill
  before running it and confirm those are the rows that died; "something went red" is
  not that, and it is how a mutation gets credited to a row it never touched. Row
  counts and pass rates are not evidence of anything; the only evidence that a suite is
  load-bearing is a record of which deliberate breakage each row detects. #14 tells you to mutate at all; this entry is
  about why the mutation comes back empty — or comes back red about code the product
  never runs — and what each of those means.
- **How this differs from rule 9 (corpus replay).** Rule 9 measures the **detector**:
  its instrument is a corpus of real commands nobody wrote for the test, and its output
  is a false-positive rate — how much legitimate work this guard will block. This entry
  measures the **suite**: its instrument is a deliberately broken implementation, and
  its output is per-assertion sensitivity — whether a row can fail at all. The two are
  orthogonal and neither substitutes for the other; rule 9's own record makes the point,
  since the 26-row suite it describes had five pieces of hook logic that could be
  deleted with every row still green. Run both — the replay says what the guard does to
  real inputs today, the mutation pass says whether the suite will notice tomorrow's
  regression.
- **Real case (2026-09-20, a private hooks repository):** two separate lines of work on
  one commit-scope gate — a parallel session and an implementation sub-agent — hit the
  first four shapes in a single evening. Its calibration shipped with every assertion
  carrying a mutation that kills it. Note the shape of that pairing, because it is not
  one-to-one: each mutation has the specific set of rows it is *supposed* to redden,
  and what was verified is that those rows are the ones that died. Three of those
  mutations exist only because writing them exposed an assertion that could not die.
  Shape 5 came out of the same gate a day later, and only because someone asked for a
  call-site audit that no plan contained.

---

## 47. A `$(( ))` error in a subcommand branch skips the branch's own `exit` — the hook runs its main path instead, and under `</dev/null` that reads as success

- **Symptom:** a reporting subcommand (`--fire-rate` and the like) prints
  `syntax error in expression` (bash 5 words it `arithmetic syntax error`),
  then behaves differently depending on stdin: left open, it hangs; closed,
  it exits 0 without printing its report. Only
  some inputs do it, typically a log with no firing rows. The same fall-through
  in a `--selftest` branch is worse, because it reports a pass. The health check
  in build-order step 4 runs each selftest as
  `bash "$h" "$mode" >/dev/null 2>&1 </dev/null`, so the main path reads an
  empty stdin and, like most hook main paths, exits 0 on empty input, while the
  error message is discarded with the rest of the output (reproduced on a
  fixture).
- **Cause:** a syntax error inside `$(( ))` is not a failed command. Bash
  prints the error, discards the whole top-level command that contains the
  expansion, and continues with the next one. When the branch is
  `if [ "${1:-}" = --fire-rate ]; then …; exit 0; fi`, the whole `if` is
  discarded, its `exit 0` included, and the next top-level command is the
  hook's main path, which reads stdin. Measured on bash 3.2.57 (macOS
  `/bin/bash`) and 5.3.15, with identical results: the plain script,
  `set -e`, `set -euo pipefail`, `trap 'exit 0' ERR`, and moving the body into
  a function all fall through to the main path; `set -o posix` exits 1 at the
  error; `let` treats the same expression as an ordinary failed command and
  stays inside the branch. So neither `-e` nor the ERR trap from SKILL.md's
  "-e or trap" bullet sees this.

  A common way for a hook to build the bad expression is a count with a fallback:
  on zero matches `grep -c` prints `0` **and** exits 1, so
  `n=$(grep -c FIRED "$LOG" || echo 0)` holds `0\n0` (#8's `wc -l || echo '?'`
  shape again), and the first `$(( n * 100 / total ))` is the syntax error.
- **Fix:**
  1. Don't build the two-line value. Put the fallback outside the substitution,
     as #8 already says: `n=$(grep -c FIRED "$LOG" 2>/dev/null) || n=0`. Zero
     matches and a missing file both end as `0`, under `set -euo pipefail` too.
  2. Keep a subcommand's failure inside the subcommand. Run the body in a
     subshell and exit with its status:
     `if [ "${1:-}" = --fire-rate ]; then ( … ); exit $?; fi`. Measured: the
     error ends the subshell with status 1, and the main path never runs.
  3. Test each subcommand on the input that makes a count zero (an empty log, a
     log with no firing rows) with stdin closed, and assert on what it prints,
     not on its status. Exit 0 is exactly what the fall-through produces.
- **Real case (2026-09-23, a private hooks repository):** two advisory hooks
  shipped `--fire-rate` with the `|| echo 0` count. On a log with no firing
  rows, one hung when run with stdin open; the other had been noted as
  "crashes, yet exits 0" and stayed unexplained until the fall-through was
  reproduced. Searching the same repository for the pattern turned up two more
  files, where the malformed value only garbled a failure message.

## 48. A suite that has not run since its dependencies changed is green by reputation — run it at HEAD before you edit, or someone else's rot lands in your diff

- **Symptom:** you change file X, run its test suite, and a row fails. You start
  debugging your own diff.
- **Cause:** the row was already failing before you touched anything — a sibling
  component the fixtures depend on changed days earlier and the suite had not been
  run since. Your change's first suite run is the first run in that window, so the
  pre-existing failure is attributed to you. Every round you spend "fixing your
  regression" is wasted, and the real repair (fixture or environment) never happens.
- **Fix:** before editing code a suite covers, run the suite once on the unmodified
  tree and record which rows already fail — that baseline turns "did I break it?"
  into a lookup. When a row fails both before and after, repair the fixture rot
  first and label it separately in the commit; folding the repair silently into your
  feature change makes the next bisect lie.
- **Real case (2026-09-29):** rewriting the LFS-verification stage of a git pre-push
  hook hit two consecutive "my edit broke the suite" rounds that were actually
  fixture rot from a whole-tree-audit change eight days prior — the rows now
  required a resolvable remote and `gitleaks` on PATH. Seeding local bare remotes
  and shimming `gitleaks` (with `git-lfs` deliberately absent, which the rows' own
  assertion needs) was the prerequisite for calibrating the rewrite at all. The
  failure had been invisible because nothing runs the suite between edits.

## 49. A selftest scheduler that signs only the registered hook file never re-runs after edits to the logic — sign what the hook runs and imports

- **Symptom:** you edit a guard's classifier, the next session's health check
  reports every hook healthy, and that guard's full battery does not run. Nothing
  warns. If the scheduler also caches passes, not even the cheap probe re-runs
  until its TTL expires.
- **Cause:** the scheduler's signature is the `stat` of the registered file, and
  for most guards that file is a thin wrapper: the decision lives in a sibling
  `guard.py`, which may import a shared module, and the battery lives in a test
  file beside it. Editing any of those leaves the wrapper untouched, so the stamp
  stays valid. #41 fixed *which inode* gets read; this is *which files*.
- **Fix:** sign the hook together with the files it executes and imports, found
  by reading them, recursively and bounded:
  1. In shell and JS files, on non-comment lines, a filename joined onto a path —
     `"$HERE/guard.py"`, `"$(dirname "$0")/lib.sh"`, `"$HOME/…"`, an absolute path —
     that exists next to the file, one directory up, or under `$HOME`, kept only
     inside the hooks tree. The walk tries all three rather than parsing `..`;
     trying one directory up is what resolves `"$DIR/../lib.sh"`.
  2. In Python files, same-directory imports: `import a`, `import a, b`,
     `from a import x`. Relative imports are not followed; a hook runs as a
     script and cannot use them.
  3. Nothing else. A comment naming a script, a bare script name in a message,
     a `case` pattern listing script names: these are data. Following them
     chains through prose. Measured on one hooks directory, a walk that followed
     bare mentions signed one guard over 18 files, including other guards and
     replay scripts. Once every hook depends on most of the directory, any edit
     re-runs every full battery and the cache is gone.

  The walk cannot tell a path-joined name inside a message or a data list from
  one in a command, so it follows those too. That over-signs only the hook that
  contains them: on the same directory, one hook of 72 (a fixture advisor that
  lists other hooks' corpora) signed 21 files. The cost is extra full runs for
  that hook, not the cache for every hook.

  Resolve the hook's symlink before walking (#41), so dependencies are found
  next to the target rather than the link (#42). Keep the failure direction: a
  hook that is missing or cannot be read (`chmod 000`) gets an empty signature.
  Treat that as unknown, not a cached pass. Make full validation due in the owning
  build/commit check; keep SessionStart limited to bounded deployment and liveness
  probes even when a full-pass stamp is absent or stale. Select only the owner's
  declared offline liveness mode; otherwise keep logic coverage unknown/incomplete.

  Sign every hook in **one** process before the scheduling loop. Shelling out per
  hook (`realpath`, `grep`, `stat` and a hash for each file) cost 1.3 s at every
  session start for 72 hooks; one Python pass took 0.14 s, less than the old
  single-`stat` loop.

  Compare the signature as one string; its first field is a list, not an mtime.
  Use this walk to discover local dependencies, not as a complete validation
  identity: its mtime/size stamps can miss same-size edits within a timestamp
  tick. Include dependency contents, the resolved runtime and its version, test
  harness and relevant configuration in the full-pass cache key. A changed key
  invalidates the pass at build/commit time; it does not schedule a full battery
  during startup.
- **Regression cases** (each has to go red when its rule is mutated away): edit
  the sibling `.py` and not the wrapper → full validation becomes due; edit a module
  that `.py` imports → it becomes due; edit a file named only in a comment, written in
  the path-joined form the walk does follow on code lines → it does **not** become due
  (this is the case that catches a walk that stopped skipping comments); reach
  the hook through a symlink and edit the target's sibling → it becomes due;
  delete a dependency → it becomes due; `import a, b` and edit `b` → it becomes
  due; make the hook unreadable → its signature is empty and status unknown;
  change the registered runtime or test harness → the cached pass is invalid.
- **Real case (2026-09-29, a private hooks repository):** a guard's classifier
  and a newly extracted shared module were edited and pushed. The health check's
  stamps, keyed on the wrapper, stayed valid, so neither the probe nor the full
  battery ran on the new logic. Across that repository's 72 installed hooks, 19
  had logic outside the registered file.

## 50. A gate that passes slowly raises no signal — and the host records the run time of only some of the hooks that succeed

- **Symptom:** every session starts a minute late, or a push waits twenty minutes,
  and nobody can say which hook is responsible. Block counts, bypass counts and
  self-test results are all healthy, because the slow hook works and exits 0.
- **Cause:** the two signals a guard normally has, "it blocked" and "it broke", say
  nothing about cost. The host writes run times for many hooks, but no report reads
  them unless you write one, and a PreToolUse hook that prints nothing may leave no
  record at all (step 1).
- **Fix:**
  1. Read the run times the host already writes. Session transcripts are JSONL
     files under the host's projects directory. A successful hook run is a record
     `{"type": "attachment", "attachment": {"type": "hook_success", …}}`, and the
     fields are inside `attachment`: `hookEvent`, `hookName`, `toolUseID`,
     `command`, `exitCode`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `content`, `durationMs`. Also count
     `hook_cancelled` (retain `timedOut` separately) and `hook_non_blocking_error`;
     read each record's actual fields before aggregating. Preserve cancellations,
     timeouts, runtime errors and guard refusals as distinct outcomes. Missing
     duration is unknown cost, not zero. Blocked runs (`hook_blocking_error`) and
     injected context (`hook_additional_context`) may carry no duration. Group by
     event and by the script's file stem; for a binary
     use its file name, and for a hook with no executable (a prompt) use the text.
     Parse `command` with Python's `shlex.split` rather than `str.split` (a path
     containing a space breaks the latter). Deduplicate forked or resumed
     transcripts using a proved per-invocation record identity. When using
     `toolUseID`, include `hookEvent`, `hookName` and command identity; identical
     commands on different events or hooks are distinct runs. Missing or empty
     identifiers do not prove duplication. Keep provenance so copied records can
     be reconciled without collapsing separate invocations. Report count, median,
     p95 and max per hook. Keep a minimum sample size for distribution alerts,
     but add a separate single-run maximum alert so one extreme successful run
     is not suppressed for lack of samples. Choose both thresholds from measured
     cost and the runtime's latency budget; do not describe a singleton's p95 as
     a reliable distribution.
     **Not every run leaves a record.** Probe: count one hook's records in a
     transcript and compare with the session's tool calls it matches. In one session
     (682 Bash calls, 2026-09-30) each PreToolUse advisor of ours had between 2 and
     29 records, every one with non-empty `stdout`, while PostToolUse, Stop and
     SessionStart hooks had silent records as well (802 of 858 PostToolUse records
     had empty `stdout`); one third-party PreToolUse binary was recorded on every
     call. So for a PreToolUse hook a record count is a count of runs that
     produced output, its median describes only those runs, and "zero records" does
     not mean "never ran". To time a silent PreToolUse hook, have it log its own
     duration (step 3).
  2. Count output as well. A hook whose `stdout` is non-empty and not `{}` is doing
     something a block count cannot see, usually injecting advisory context, so a
     block-count report shows it as silent or dead. Read its JSON before calling it
     advisory: a hook that exits 0 with `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` set
     to `deny`, or a top-level `decision` of `block`, does block. A tool that prints
     `{}` on every call is not an advisor.
  3. Guards that git runs, not the host, never appear in a transcript. Have the
     guard append one line per run (time, name, seconds, exit code, repository) to a
     state log, and read that log in the same report. Print one "still running" line
     from inside the guard's long loop once a single run passes a threshold (60 s in
     the case below), so no background process is needed. That threshold is one
     run's seconds; the median and p95 lines in step 1 describe a hook's whole
     distribution. Set them separately.
  4. A health check that runs every hook's full self-test at session start is a
     common slow pass. Put the full battery in the owning build/commit check;
     startup may run bounded deployment and owner-declared offline bidirectional
     liveness probes. A missing mode leaves logic coverage unknown/incomplete;
     never fall back to a selftest battery or machine audit. Use
     #49's dependency and runtime identity for any pass cache, with separate probe
     and full-pass stamps. A failed, timed-out, cancelled or unexamined test writes
     no pass stamp (#53). Give individual probes and the entire startup scan their
     own deadlines and clean up only their own descendants. Keep failed diagnostic
     output and report the checked and unexamined boundary when the total budget
     ends. Measure startup and full-validation costs separately: a changed helper,
     missing stamp or expired cache must not move the full battery back to startup.
     Compare old and new on one machine under similar load.
- **Real case (2026-09-29, one hooks repository):** adding per-hook timing to a
  weekly hook report showed a SessionStart health check at a median of 65 s over 257
  runs in a week. A trace (`bash -x` with `PS4='+T$SECONDS '`, then the largest gaps
  between lines) put the time in about thirty hooks' self-tests, some 5 to 11 s
  each. With the signature-and-TTL skip, four old runs alternated with four new ones
  on one machine took 69 to 83 s before and 4 to 20 s after; the fastest new run
  had warm stamps, and the first (16 s) ran the two full self-tests that had no
  stamp yet. The 65 s median came from other times and load. In the same week, a
  global pre-push check that took 22 to 29 minutes per new branch, and moved no
  count in that report, was attributed by the commit that fixed it to a full tree
  listing for every commit in the range. The first version of that report also
  printed "0 runs in the window" for silent guards; the probe in step 1 showed the
  wording was wrong, and the report now says "0 records" and states the coverage.

## 51. Adding a run recorder to a guard: `exec` skips your trap, other sessions' fixtures fill the log, and a missing stamp leaks a redirect error

- **Symptom:** the recorder never logs the runs of a hook that ends in `exec`; the
  log on its first day is mostly rows nobody ran; a first run prints
  `No such file or directory` on stderr although the code redirects that error; and
  a new self-test row makes the whole self-test exit silently with status 2.
- **Cause and fix**, in four parts (bash, and zsh for part 3):
  1. `exec` replaces the process, so an EXIT trap is never reached. Replace
     `exec child "$@"` with
     `child_rc=0; child "$@" || child_rc=$?; exit "$child_rc"` and keep the EXIT
     trap that records the run: it then fires once, with the child's status, for
     this path and for every path that leaves before the child. Do not also call
     the recorder before `exit`, or the run is logged twice. The child's refusal
     must reach the caller unchanged, so this is a security edit, and a passing
     suite does not show it: the usual fixtures make the guard's own checks refuse
     before the child runs, and they pass with `exit 0` hard-coded. Test it with a
     stub child that exits 7 and assert both the hook's status and the recorded
     one. A mutation that swallowed the status survived until that test existed.
  2. A fixture repository's git hooks fire the real global guards, so every
     self-test and test suite, from every session, writes to a machine-wide log.
     Asking each suite to redirect it holds until the next session forgets. Filter
     in the writer instead: skip a repository whose top-level path
     (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`) starts with `/tmp/`, `/private/tmp/`,
     `/var/folders/`, `/private/var/folders/` (macOS resolves the first and third to
     the `/private` spellings) or `${TMPDIR%/}/`. Write the prefixes with the
     trailing slash: `/tmp*` also matches a sibling such as `/tmpfoo`. Guard the
     `TMPDIR` test with `[[ -n "${TMPDIR:-}" && … ]]`: with `TMPDIR` unset or empty
     the pattern becomes `/*`, and every path counts as a fixture. Give the suites
     that assert on the log an explicit opt-in variable, for example
     `RECORD_TEMP=1`. Cleaning the log afterwards by name patterns never finishes,
     because fixtures are named by whoever writes them.
  3. In bash and zsh, `read -r a b < "$stamp" 2>/dev/null` applies the redirections
     left to right, so the failing `<` prints its error before `2>/dev/null`
     exists. Write `read -r a b 2>/dev/null < "$stamp" || true`, and assert that a
     first run prints nothing to stderr.
  4. In a self-test, `text=$(run_the_guard_on_a_blocked_input)` returns the guard's
     status 2 and, under `set -e`, ends the script silently with that status, so the
     health check reports the hook as dead. Add `|| true` inside the helper when the
     output is what you want, and compare the new self-test's exit status with the
     old version's before trusting a green run.
- **Real case (2026-09-29, one hooks repository):** after per-run timing went into
  three git guards (pre-commit, pre-push and one that blocks recursive backups), 507
  of the log's first 552 lines came from the temporary repositories of tests, under
  many naming schemes; two attempts to clean the log by name each dropped real rows
  or kept fixture rows. The writer-side path filter ended it. In the same change,
  turning `exec` into a child call passed the whole suite with the status swallowed,
  and the health check's stamp read printed a redirect error on every hook's first
  sight.

## 52. `$var` glued to full-width punctuation is one long variable name in a UTF-8 locale — and the detector you print must name its engine

- **Symptom:** under `set -u`, the script aborts with `<name><mojibake>: unbound
  variable` on a line whose variable was provably set a few lines above. The
  happy path never reaches that line, so the bug lives in exactly the
  retry/failure branch the line was written for.
- **Cause and fix:** in a UTF-8 locale, bash admits the high bytes of a
  multibyte character into the variable name, so `$rc；` or `$rc（` parses as
  one long unbound name. Measured matrix (2026-09-30, macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2
  and Homebrew 5.3 × C / POSIX / en_US.UTF-8 / zh_CN.UTF-8 / unset): **UTF-8
  glues on both builds; C/POSIX is clean on both**; the builds differ only
  when the locale is unset entirely — 3.2 falls back to C (clean) while 5.3
  falls back to the macOS default UTF-8 (glues), which is the launchd shape
  (minimal env, no locale variables). So the safety boundary is the locale,
  not the build: explicit C/POSIX protects every bash, and both
  "the C locale is what glues" and "system bash is safe" are
  plausible-sounding and false. Fix is engine-independent: brace every
  expansion that is immediately followed by non-ASCII text — `${rc}`. ⚠️ The detector you ship with this rule must
  name its engine: the byte-class regex `\$[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*[\x80-\xff]`
  is correct only as a **byte** scan (Python `re` on `rb""` bytes, or
  `rg '(?-u)' …`); under rg/ugrep's default Unicode-aware mode the same
  pattern reads as codepoints U+0080–U+00FF and misses full-width punctuation
  (U+FF08/U+FF1B) entirely — printing the bare regex with no engine note hands
  the reader a false-clean instrument, the exact failure #53 describes.
  Verify any detector on a known-bad sample before trusting its "clean".
- **Real case (2026-09-30):** a nightly sync script gained a retry loop; both
  new Chinese log lines carried the glue. It fired in the calibration harness
  (which ran under Homebrew bash) and would have fired for every
  `#!/usr/bin/env bash` hook — 104 of 119 checked scripts in one hooks
  directory, versus 15 on `/bin/bash` 3.2. The script being edited was itself
  on 3.2, so under launchd's unset locale it would not have hit the bug in
  production — but the same script in any UTF-8 locale (an interactive
  login shell, for instance) would have, because 3.2 glues there too. Both
  statements matter: the bug was real and the harness caught it, and the
  harness, not the production shebang, was the vulnerable layer. This entry
  was itself wrong twice and caught by re-probe both times: the first draft
  claimed the opposite causality ("the C locale glues") and shipped the
  engine-less detector regex; the rewrite then claimed 3.2 was immune under
  every locale, which a UTF-8 re-probe of `/bin/bash` contradicted.

## 53. A validator that folds "the call failed" into "nothing found" manufactures false greens

- **Symptom:** a review or check logs "no issues found" for input it never
  actually examined. The failure appears only in a debug log; the run that died
  and the run that was clean are byte-identical to anyone reading the outcome.
- **Cause and fix:** `if not result:` folds `result is None` (the API/tool call
  failed) and "result exists and is empty" (genuinely clean) into one branch.
  Failure, empty, and unexamined are three states and must log as three:
  `if result is None: log "review NOT completed — UNKNOWN"` before the clean
  branch. Then make the failure visible where the user actually looks (a
  system message / status line), because a failure that only writes a debug
  log is a pass. If the check lives in a vendor file that marketplace refreshes
  overwrite, land the patch with a marker comment plus an idempotent repatch
  script plus a health-check assertion that re-applies it on refresh and only
  pages a human when the repatch script's anchors no longer match (meaning
  upstream changed the code under the patch).
- **Real case (2026-09-29, a security-review plugin):** primary and fallback
  models both died on proxy-cut TLS in two burst clusters; the fire was logged
  "no vulnerabilities found" — one confirmed false green among the day's 170
  reviews, and the same None-vs-clean fold existed in three branches across
  two of its files. The repaired build's regression harness goes red on exactly
  the failure-direction rows when run against the unpatched copy.

## 54. A detector keyed on neighbour-line heuristics false-alerts on recovery — key on the subject's own terminal marker

- **Symptom:** the health detector reports more failures than the subject
  itself recorded — because its rule ("the previous non-noise line is a
  terminal failure") stays true across a *successful* fallback: the
  "falling back to <model>" line was itself on the detector's noise list, so
  the recovery was invisible to it.
- **Cause and fix:** neighbour-line heuristics cannot see events they filter
  out. Prefer the marker the subject prints only when it truly failed — here,
  the per-fire closing line `API call failed with status`, emitted iff the
  fire's final call failed. Then calibrate the rewritten criterion against the
  real log in both directions on the same day: the fallback-succeeded fire must
  *not* alert, the genuinely-failed fire must.
- **Real case (2026-09-29, same incident family as #53):** the old criterion
  reported 2 silent failures for a day that had exactly 1; the marker-keyed
  criterion reports 1, and after the #53 fail-loud patch the new UNKNOWN lines
  became the counted signal — detector and patched subject agree. One blind
  spot to name, not to hide: if the subject *dies before printing* its terminal
  marker (crash mid-fire, not a handled API error), the detector stays silent —
  the marker only covers failure paths the subject itself survives.

## 55. A dash-leading path argument is parsed as options — `--` works even on macOS, but parameter expansion skips the subprocess and the option table entirely

- **Symptom:** a repair or fallback branch fails on *every single file* with a
  bare usage error from a basic utility (`dirname: illegal option -- U`),
  in a code path that passed calibration against real-corpus fixtures.
- **Cause and fix:** any path derived from data can start with a dash (here:
  every project directory under `~/.claude/projects/` is named
  `-Users-<name>-…`, so a relative path stripped from it inherits the dash).
  A tool that parses options rejects such an operand because its letters
  are not in the tool's optstring — `dirname`/`basename` take no options at
  all, so *any* dash-leading operand fails. The escape: `--` works fine on
  macOS BSD userland (`dirname -- "$rel"` verified on Darwin 25; these tools
  go through getopt, which handles `--` natively) — prefer parameter
  expansion anyway: `${rel%/*}` for dirname, `${rel##*/}` for basename (plus
  the no-slash guard `[ "$d" = "$rel" ] && d="."`) spawns no subprocess and
  has no per-tool option table to remember, so it cannot regress the day
  someone swaps in a tool with different parsing. The calibration half of the lesson: this branch
  was calibrated against the real error-report corpus with a stubbed uploader,
  and the fixture proved the *parser* (report line → extracted path) while the
  stub boundary was drawn one layer too far out — the filesystem calls the
  extracted path then flowed into (`mkdir`/`cp`) were never exercised against
  a dash-leading input. A stub must stand in at the outermost effect boundary;
  every layer between parser and boundary is uncalibrated surface.
- **Real case (2026-09-30, a nightly OSS backup):** active-session `.jsonl`
  files lose an append race during the backup window (Content-Length stales
  mid-upload), so a targeted snapshot re-upload branch existed: parse the
  failed files from the uploader's report, `cp` each to a static temp dir,
  re-upload. Its first real run: 5/5 snapshots "failed" —
  `mkdir -p "$repair_dir/$(dirname "$rel")"` died on the dash-leading rel,
  leaving `cp` no directory to land in. The main backup had already failed
  rc=4 on all three retries, so the branch whose whole purpose was surviving
  that exact failure mode died on a second, unrelated one — at 03:00, with no
  one watching. Parameter expansion fixed it; the manual re-run uploaded 5/5
  with bucket-side read-back. One more correction, same night: this entry's
  first published version converted the incident into a wrong platform claim
  ("macOS BSD tools accept no `--`"); post-merge review re-probed and
  `dirname --` returned the correct answer — the third time in one night a
  mechanism claim in this family was falsified by re-running the probe
  instead of believing the plausible explanation (see #52's two corrections).
  The incident facts were all reproducible; only the generalization was
  wrong.

## 56. A medium heredoc can block Bash before its reader starts on macOS

- **Symptom:** a hook stops during heredoc setup, before its intended child
  produces output; syntax checks pass and the same script may work under another
  shell or system load.
- **Cause:** an affected Bash build chooses a pipe using a capacity measured at
  compile time. macOS can reduce the available pipe capacity with system-wide
  pipe usage. Writing the heredoc before a reader starts can then block. This is
  a shell redirection failure, not evidence that the child or its service hung.
  GNU Bash's [bash53-016 patch](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-5.3-patches/bash53-016)
  uses a nonblocking write and falls back to a temporary file on capacity errors.
- **Diagnose and repair:** identify the exact registered Bash executable and
  patch level. Use a bounded harmless reproduction and process evidence to
  distinguish shell setup from a running child; retain unknown when that evidence
  is missing. Verify the patched build or use a tested file-backed input under
  the hook's existing contract. Re-run through the registered executable, not
  whichever `bash` happens to resolve in an interactive shell. Do not turn an
  observed capacity into a constant for every macOS machine, or stress the live
  host by exhausting its pipes to reproduce it. Keep the startup deadline from
  #50 even after fixing this particular cause.
## 57. bash 3.2 scans a quoted heredoc *inside `$( )`* for quote characters — one stray backtick in a body comment kills the whole file, and every guard in it dies silently

  Sibling of #56, same macOS heredoc family, opposite phase: #56 is the
  *writer* blocking before the reader starts; this one is the *parser*
  miscounting quotes before anything runs.

- **Symptom:** `bash -n file` fails with
  `unexpected EOF while looking for matching '`'`, and the line it names is deep
  inside a quoted heredoc body — an innocent Python line, or even a comment — far
  from any real quoting error. Several hook files fail at once after one routine
  edit. The file is dead *in toto*: the shell cannot parse it, so the hook never
  runs at all, and a hook whose contract is "always exit 0" (an injector, a
  reminder) gives no signal that it has stopped running.
- **Cause and fix:** on macOS, `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves to the stock
  **bash 3.2** (it stays first in PATH even after a newer bash is installed), and
  bash 3.2 parses the body of a quoted heredoc that sits **inside a command
  substitution** with quote awareness: every `'`, `"`, and `` ` `` in the body —
  including inside comments and example code — toggles parser quote state. One
  line with an odd count (a markdown-ish `` `) ))"` `` in a comment is enough)
  poisons everything after it; the error then surfaces at EOF or at a random
  later line. The same bytes at top level parse fine — identical body outside
  `$( )`, different verdict — which sends you hunting in the wrong place. The
  fix is structural, not quote-whack-a-mole: **hoist the heredoc out of the
  command substitution.** Read the program into a variable at top level (top-level
  quoted heredocs are immune — verified against the failing bytes), then execute
  it *through the environment*, not the command line:
  `IFS= read -rd '' PROG <<'EOF' … EOF || true`, then
  `PROG="$PROG" python3 -c 'import os;exec(os.environ["PROG"])'` — env values are
  never re-parsed by the shell, so `$`, backticks, and backslashes pass through
  byte-exact. Do **not** reach for `python3 -c "$PROG"`: inside double quotes the
  program text is re-expanded — a regex like `$((…))` in a comment becomes
  arithmetic expansion and `$(…)` becomes command substitution, the same bug
  class in a new costume (and a cousin of #9). Do not "fix" it by rebalancing
  quotes in the comments either — the next comment re-breaks it; the hoisted
  form makes the body permanently inert to the shell parser.
- **Real case (2026-10-03/04, a 61-hook guard fleet):** a routine commit edited
  four hook files whose Python bodies lived in `$(python3 - <<'EOF' …)` blocks.
  Comment edits left a stray backtick in one body and an escaped `\"` in another;
  all four files failed `bash -n` whole-file, so four production guards — among
  them a push *injector* whose contract is to always exit 0 — silently stopped
  running. Nothing fired for hours: exit codes stayed green by design, and the
  only detector that caught it was the SessionStart health check's *syntax*
  pass (its selftest stamps happily re-validated the other hooks). The first
  repair attempt then demonstrated the second half of the trap: editing the
  body to please the *shell* parser (dropping a backslash before a quote inside
  a Python raw string) converted the shell syntax error into a *Python* syntax
  error that only fired at runtime under `2>/dev/null` — invisible to
  `bash -n`, caught only because the bidirectional selftest asserted both a
  must-fire and a must-quiet row. Two confirmations in one incident: whole-file
  parse failure is the failure mode that turns one stray character into a dead
  fleet, and only a two-sided selftest sees a guard that dies in ways exit
  codes cannot show.

## 58. A read-only query on WAL state can fail only in the quiet hours — `mode=ro` plus an environment that cannot create `-shm`, not `mode=ro` alone

- **Symptom:** a hook's read-only statistics command (`--status`, `--eval-queue`)
  fails with `sqlite3.OperationalError` — but only *sometimes*. It worked
  through the busy hours and failed at 3am; it failed under `env -i` and in
  launchd, then worked again once sessions started generating events. Swapping
  the open to a plain read-write connection plus `PRAGMA query_only = ON` made
  it pass in the same environment, in the same minute, on the same database.
- **Cause and fix:** the code opened the WAL-mode database with
  `sqlite3.connect(f"file:{path}?mode=ro", uri=True)`. **Read this far
  carefully, because the first published version of this entry got the
  mechanism wrong and was rewritten after independent review measured it:**
  `mode=ro` does NOT, by itself, make a WAL open fail — on a writable
  directory a read-only connection happily creates the `-shm`/`-wal` side
  files itself (measured on libsqlite 3.50.4). The failure needs an
  environment that *cannot* create those side files (a read-only or sandboxed
  directory, a TCC denial) or another not-fully-identified transient state —
  which is exactly the shape that hides in production: busy hours keep a hot
  `-wal`/`-shm` around so the read-only open succeeds, quiet hours remove
  them and the same code fails, so nobody reproduces it until 3am. Two
  refinements the review added: the side-file-blocked form reports
  `attempt to write a readonly database`, while `unable to open database
  file` points at a missing directory / unreadable file / sandbox EPERM —
  read the error text, not just the exception type; and
  `sqlite3.connect(path)` succeeding is *not* evidence the environment is
  healthy, because connect() opens lazily and only the first statement
  touches the file. The fix that worked at the incident site (writable state
  directory): a normal connection plus `PRAGMA busy_timeout` and
  `PRAGMA query_only = ON`. If the directory genuinely cannot be written,
  that fix fails the same way — there the working read-only channel is
  `file:...?immutable=1`, at the explicit price of seeing no concurrent
  writes. Do not ship `mode=ro` against WAL state you do not control the
  directory of.
- **Real case (2026-10-06):** `goal-reanchor`'s evaluation queue had carried
  this since its first version, discovered only while automating the
  outcome-evaluation loop that had silently never run: the manual eval flow
  worked in the afternoon (hooks firing everywhere), the first launchd run
  of the batch job failed at night. The fix above restored the command in
  both interactive and `env -i` replays. Two stacked lessons: the failure is
  *invisible to any test that runs while the system under test is also
  active* — the fix was verified by replaying the command after the writers
  stopped, not by the unit suite; and an operations SOP whose steps all
  "work when tried interactively" can sit on a time bomb for months because
  nobody runs them on a quiet database. The mechanism section you just read
  is its second version: the first one asserted "`mode=ro` always fails on a
  checkpointed WAL", an independent review measured the assertion false on
  the same SQLite build, and the entry was rewritten — treat the environment
  condition, not the open mode, as the suspect.

## 59. Adding a column without bumping the schema version makes the migration never run — and every writer fails open at once

- **Symptom:** right after deploying a schema change, every hook invocation
  across every session and host starts recording the *same* error
  (`OperationalError: no such column: floor_at`), hundreds of receipts per
  hour, while the hook "keeps working" (it fails open by design). The
  migration code is present and correct; it simply never executes.
- **Cause and fix:** the migration was gated on
  `PRAGMA user_version < STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, and the deploy changed the
  DDL and the queries but not the constant — the production database was
  already stamped with the old version, so the gate evaluated to "nothing to
  do" on every open. Any migration trigger (version pragma, sentinel file,
  flag row) makes the version identifier *part of the schema change itself*:
  adding a column without moving the identifier is an incomplete edit of the
  same atomic change, the way changing a detector without its fixtures is.
  Write the version bump into the same commit and assert it from the test
  suite (a calibration test that pins the constant to its date-stamped value
  caught the mismatch in the follow-up — but only after production had
  already burned the receipts).
- **Real case (2026-10-06, same deploy as #58's sibling work):** a cadence
  hook added a `floor_at` column, bumped the policy version string but not
  `STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION`. ~1100 error receipts accumulated in ~25 minutes of
  double-registration concurrency before the constant was fixed; the first
  post-fix open migrated the database and the receipts stopped. The failure
  was loud in aggregate but invisible per-invocation — fail-open hooks need
  an *error-receipt rate* in their health check, because "no crash" and
  "healthy" diverge exactly here.

## 60. `all([])` is True — an empty group's "all commands managed" check launders it into the privileged branch

- **Symptom:** an alignment/authorization routine that treats "every command
  in this group is known-good" as the condition for a trusted path starts
  *refusing legitimate empty shell groups* (or, with the polarity flipped,
  starts *trusting* them) — and the bug survives code review because the
  one-liner reads correctly in English.
- **Cause and fix:** `all(...)` over an empty iterable is vacuously True, so
  `all(c in managed for c in [])` reports an empty group as "fully managed".
  Shell groups with `hooks: []` are not rare leftovers here — a migration
  that strips handlers from a group deliberately leaves the empty shell in
  place (deleting it would shift every later group's position in the list,
  and list position is execution order).
  Decide the empty case **out loud** at the branch: name it in a comment and
  make the code say it — `cur_managed = any(...)` when "empty means not
  managed", `bool(cmds) and all(...)` when "empty means nothing to vouch
  for". The general form: any predicate written as `all(...)` that gates a
  trusted/allowed path needs an explicit answer for the empty input before it
  needs a clever one for the hard inputs.
- **Real case (2026-10-07):** a reconcile subcommand's ledger-alignment walk
  classified current groups with `all(command in managed_commands)`. Empty
  shell groups read as "managed", hit the "a managed group sitting out of
  ledger order" refusal, and blocked a legitimate reconcile of six live
  settings files. Found by a hand-driven replay of the alignment loop, not
  by the first three read-throughs of the diff — the code reviewer's eye
  slides over `all(...)` because the sentence it forms is grammatically
  true. An adversarial review agent later found the *mirror* bug in the same
  walk (a foreign handler riding inside a duplicate of a managed group),
  which is why the fix also moved the predicate from `all` to `any` for the
  "is this group managed at all" question.

## 61. An advisory's context lands bundled with the tool result — judging hook timing from that delivery position misreads a PreToolUse fire as post-hoc

- **Symptom:** an advisory hook's `additionalContext` shows up in the
  conversation flow *next to the tool result*, after the tool ran. The
  diagnostician reads the delivery position as the firing time, concludes
  "the reminder only arrives after the fact," and proposes moving the hook to
  PreToolUse — where it has been registered all along. In the measured case
  the retelling went one step further and confabulated a wrong surface label
  ("PostToolUse") that the transcript's own records contradict — the label
  had been correct; only the position was misleading.
- **Cause and fix:** the hook *run* and the *delivery* of its
  `additionalContext` are two different records. The run is PreToolUse (it
  evaluates before the tool executes); the injected context is attached to
  the transcript adjacent to the tool result, and the harness renders its
  label from the hook's event name — so trust the label, distrust the
  position. Before diagnosing any hook-timing question, find the hook's run
  record in the session transcript
  (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session>.jsonl` — the attachment
  carrying `durationMs` and the hook's command line) and read the event name
  from there. The adjacent design fact that makes this matter: an advisory
  (exit 0 + context) structurally cannot prevent the call it fires on — the
  model emitted that call before the hook ran, and the official contract
  reserves stopping the call for block/deny — so the reminder only teaches
  *subsequent* calls. If the rule must stop the current call, it has to
  block; choose that by proportionality, not by habit.
- **Real case (2026-10-07):** a branch-delete advisor fired PreToolUse
  ("Checking repo policies", 155ms) with the trial-merge reminder ahead of a
  `git branch -D` riding at the end of a compound command; the reminder
  arrived bundled with the tool result and was misread as post-hoc — and the
  incident write-up even invented a "PostToolUse" label that the transcript
  contradicts. The run record, not the delivery position, settled it. The
  label confabulation survived into this entry's own first draft and was
  caught only by the release review — this failure mode recurs even inside
  the document warning about it.

## 62. Fleet-wide hook timeouts were an overloaded machine, not broken hooks — check load and the process census before touching any hook

- **Symptom:** every hook on the machine starts timing out at once —
  PreToolUse guards blowing their 60-second budgets, a SessionStart
  health check exceeding its deadline, a third-party hook reporting
  "protection check deadline exceeded". Each hook passes its own unit
  tests, and times out again on the very next call.
- **Cause and fix:** the hooks are victims, not suspects. One parent
  process — in the real case a per-thread MCP server spawner that never
  reaped its children — had accumulated ~300 child processes (141 copies
  of one stdio↔SSE proxy, 123 copies of a desktop-automation app) and
  pushed the load average to 243 on a machine whose comfortable ceiling
  is ~20. Every hook process simply could not get CPU before its
  deadline. The one-minute diagnostic order: `sysctl -n vm.loadavg`
  first — a fleet-wide symptom with load in the hundreds is an
  environment problem, full stop; then `ps -Ao pid,ppid,command`
  aggregated by PPID (e.g. `ps -Ao ppid= | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn |
  head`) — one parent holding hundreds of children IS the leak, and no
  automatic mechanism ever terminates a live process somebody else
  spawned: launchd only reaps zombies, it never kills live adoptees, so
  unless the spawner or the user kills them, they accumulate for days. The fix lives
  at the daemon/config level, never inside any hook — and on a shared
  machine, process-level remediation belongs to the user, not to an
  agent: report the diagnosis, do not kill. (A standing rule born from
  this incident: agents must not terminate other sessions' processes,
  including via a "daemon restart" whose documented side effect is
  killing its children.)
- **Real case (2026-10-07):** codex app-server 0.160.1 spawned the full
  enabled-MCP set for every conversation thread and never reaped them
  when threads ended; 304 accumulated children — MCP proxies plus 123
  GUI app copies, the latter also hammering WindowServer — produced
  load average 243 and simultaneous "hook timeout" reports from three
  independent agent fleets. A daemon restart brought load back to ~22
  within minutes; every "failing" hook passed, untouched. The
  hook-fleet lesson: a health check that only inspects hooks will
  report this as "69 hooks unverified" and send you reading hook
  source — the load check has to come before the hook check.

## 63. A working main path proves nothing about the suppression/degraded path — calibrate each path bidirectionally, on its own corpus

- **Symptom:** a gate/alert's action path is calibrated and provably
  works (the page goes out, the guard blocks), while its suppression or
  degraded branch — the path that should fire *less* — has never once
  fired since it shipped. Nobody notices, because "correctly silent"
  and "dead silent" are indistinguishable from the outside: the
  suppression path produces no output when it works *and* no output
  when it is structurally impossible. The death of a suppression path
  is silent by construction.
- **Cause and fix:** bidirectional calibration was run only on the
  action path — dangerous side (does it fire) and healthy side (does it
  pass clean input) both proven there, zero probes aimed at the
  suppression branch. That branch carries its own independent
  always-false conditions, and they compound: in the real case the
  suppression required channel `status==3` while the pool's slot-mode
  design deliberately parks peers at `status=2` — an empty intersection
  by construction — *and* its text prefixes only matched
  monthly/weekly exhaustion wording, missing the 5-hour variant its own
  pool produced. Two always-false layers stacked, so the suppression
  never fired once — not even in the scenario it existed for (a
  genuinely pool-wide weekly exhaustion paging hourly for days). The
  seven midnight pages that triggered the investigation are NOT that
  evidence: they were single-account 5-hour exhaustions with a parked
  peer still holding quota, so the predicate was *correctly* false for
  them — those pages walked through a working design, and fixing the
  suppression could never have silenced them (a `threshold=3` debounce
  did). A suppression path's death is proven by "it never fires even
  when its own scenario occurs", never by "pages got through".
  The calibration record for the main path stayed green the
  whole time, which is exactly the trap: main-path green says nothing
  about branch liveness. The fix is to unfold the calibration matrix by
  path: every path (main / suppression / degraded / fallback) × both
  sides (should-fire / should-not-fire) gets at least one real corpus
  entry, and "this path has never fired in production" is itself a
  finding to investigate — not evidence that nothing needed it.
  Structural always-false conditions are found by reading the condition
  against the *writer's* semantics (who sets `status=2` vs `3` and
  when), not by re-running the main path.
- **Real case (2026-10-07):** the SLS phone-alert VOICE_GUARD for
  `kimi_dual_account_exhausted` carried a `quota_confirmed == "1"`
  suppression meant to silence pages whose exhaustion was already
  confirmed by the quota sampler. Investigation of a midnight-page
  cluster (7 false pages from the 30–161s serial-burn routing vacuum,
  fixed separately by `threshold=3`) incidentally found the suppression
  had never fired since deployment — and would never have fired in its
  intended scenario either (a pool-wide weekly exhaustion): the
  annotation predicate required `channel status == 3`, but the Kimi
  pool's slot mode parks standby accounts at `status = 2` by design, so
  the intersection was empty on every evaluation; and the sampler's
  exhaustion-text prefixes covered only monthly/weekly wording, missing
  the 5-hour variant. Both layers had to be fixed (status predicate
  widened to `IN (2,3)`, 5-hour prefix added, and a latest.json fast
  path made the authoritative source) before the suppression could fire
  for the first time — months after it shipped. The midnight pages
  themselves were never its jurisdiction: with a parked peer still
  holding quota, `quota_confirmed` is *correctly* 0 — the page-through
  was the design working, not the suppression failing. The main path's
  calibration corpus had shown "page goes out" the entire time; no
  corpus entry had ever asked "does the guard stay quiet when it
  should."

## 64. skill-creator-guard's "loaded" verdict requires byte-verified Read coverage — Skill-tool invocation does not count, paged Reads leak seam lines, and parallel Reads race the ledger

- **Symptom:** you loaded skill-creator this session — via the Skill
  tool, or by reading its SKILL.md in a few big paged Reads — yet the
  guard still blocks your SKILL.md edit with "load skill-creator
  first". Re-invoking the Skill doesn't help; neither does topping up
  the coverage with a parallel batch of small gap Reads.
- **Cause and fix:** the marker is written only when the session
  ledger records the *entire* file's bytes as verified, and three
  independent mechanics conspire against reaching that. ① The Skill
  tool's output is invisible to the hook (`response-empty-or-unknown`),
  so a Skill invocation records zero verified bytes and even *clears*
  any stale marker — only Read accumulates coverage. (Literal cat/sed
  also feeds the ledger in the current implementation, but one serial
  `sed` was observed not to register, cause not isolated — until
  diagnosed, the numbered serial Read is the only known-reliable
  form; see the Real case.) ② A paged Read verifies every line *except the page's
  last one*: the hook reconstructs file bytes from the numbered
  output, and the final displayed line carries no trailing newline, so
  the requested range never matches exactly and the fallback covers
  only up to the second-to-last line. Reading a 1965-line file in 7
  pages leaks 6 seam lines of a few bytes each — top them up with
  small windowed Reads centered on each seam. ③ Topping up in
  parallel loses updates: every PostToolUse event reads the ledger,
  merges, and writes it back with no transaction, so six parallel gap
  Reads raced and later writes silently discarded ranges earlier calls
  in the same batch had just recorded — the verified-byte count went
  *down* between two of the calls. Re-read the gaps serially. Don't
  guess which lines are missing: inspect the ledger itself — find this
  session's file with `ls ~/.local/state/daymade-agent-hooks/skill-creator-loaded/`
  (`<session-id>.read-coverage.json`), read the verified intervals
  from `files["<path>"].verified_ranges`, and convert byte offsets to
  line numbers with
  `python3 -c "import bisect; d=open('<file>','rb').read(); s=[0]+[i+1 for i,c in enumerate(d) if c==10]; print(bisect.bisect_right(s, <byte>))"`.
- **Real case (2026-10-07):** an o11y SKILL.md edit in a worktree was
  blocked right after a Skill-tool load of skill-creator. The author
  read the 220,657-byte file in 7 paged Reads (coverage stalled at
  220,418), computed six seam gaps totalling 239 bytes from the
  ledger, and topped them up with 6 *parallel* windowed Reads — the
  ledger dropped from 220,615 to 220,571 as the parallel PostToolUse
  events overwrote each other, discarding the +86-byte seam one call
  had just recorded. One serial re-read of the last missing line
  brought coverage to 220,657/220,657, the marker landed, and the
  edit passed. A `sed -n '1428p'` read of the same line in between
  did not move coverage either (the shell-read path shares the same
  ledger and the same race; it was not isolated further once the
  serial Read worked — treat numbered serial Reads as the reliable
  form).
