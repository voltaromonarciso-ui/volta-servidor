#!/usr/bin/env bash
# End-to-end test harness for a Claude Code hook.
#
# WHY a script file (not inline Bash commands): once a PreToolUse hook is live in
# the session, any Bash command you issue that contains the trigger token gets
# blocked by the hook before it runs — you can't test it from your own command
# line. Running `bash test_hook.sh` works because the OUTER command
# ("bash test_hook.sh") doesn't contain the trigger; the triggers live inside
# this file where the live hook never inspects them.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file next to your hook.
#   2. Set HOOK to your hook's path.
#   3. Fill the `run` table: trigger cases (want exit 2) + healthy-lookalike
#      cases (want exit 0). The healthy-lookalike rows are the important ones —
#      they prove you don't false-block (误杀健康输入比漏报更糟).
#   4. bash test_hook.sh   # run it through bash, not ./test_hook.sh: the copy
#      may not carry an exec bit, and `bash <file>` works regardless.
#
# It runs `bash -n` (syntax — a corrupted PreToolUse hook poisons the whole
# session) then every case, and reports pass/fail.

# says <label> <json-event> <grep-pattern> <yes|no>
#   Asserts on the hook's stderr TEXT, not its exit code. Needed whenever the
#   hook's real product is its guidance message — a PreToolUse explanation, a Stop
#   reminder. Break the wording, invert an optional paragraph's condition, let a
#   heredoc swallow a section: the exit code is unchanged and every `run` row still
#   passes, so an exit-code-only suite is structurally blind to it (pitfall #14).
#   Assert BOTH polarities, across two fixtures: the paragraph appears for the
#   input it targets (want=yes), and is absent for the lookalike it must skip
#   (want=no). A want=no row alone passes vacuously when the hook prints nothing
#   at all — so it is only meaningful next to a want=yes row proving the hook
#   speaks. Do not try to put both polarities on ONE fixture: a healthy input is
#   supposed to be silent, so it has no want=yes partner — its partner is the
#   trigger fixture.
#   CHANNEL NOTE: `says` captures STDERR (right for blocking hooks — their
#   contract text lives there). An exit-0 injector (PostToolUse emitting
#   hookSpecificOutput JSON on STDOUT, Pattern D) is invisible to it — assert on
#   stdout instead: out=$(printf '%s' "$2" | "$HOOK" 2>/dev/null).

  # `path [skill]` is the motivating case. As a BRE, "[skill]" is a CHARACTER
  # CLASS: it matches any text containing s, k, i or l, so `says … "[skill]" yes`
  # is true of almost any English output and the row is decorative. Measured.

#   ↑ wrapper/abs-path rows prove the walk is wrapper-aware (a bare-head check
#   passes these); comment-merge proves word-start `#` comments don't open a
#   phantom quote (`# it's` used to glue TRIGGER into echo's args → miss).
#   ↑ the multiline row is not optional: shlex treats newlines as whitespace, so
#   a one-stage walker collapses the block into one segment headed by `cd` and
#   never sees TRIGGER (pitfall #11). It only passes if your hook splits into
#   lines FIRST, shell-aware — `split_shell_lines`, which is what Pattern A and
#   the walker section both ship. A plain text split (`cmd.split("\n")`) passes
#   THIS row but false-blocks the `quoted-multiline` row below; run both.
# Healthy-lookalike cases (want 0) — THESE are what prove you don't false-block:
run "quoted-multiline" '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"echo \"line1\nTRIGGER was the culprit\nline3\""}}' 0
#   ↑ quoted-multiline is the trap sibling of "multiline": a text-level line
#   split fragments it and false-blocks (pitfall #11 residual); only a
#   quote-state-aware splitter (split_shell_lines) passes it.
run "grep-regex-arg" '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"grep -E \"a|TRIGGER|b\" file"}}' 0

run "function-def"   '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"TRIGGER() { echo stub; }"}}' 0
#   ↑ introspect row: `command -v` is a query, not an execution — a wrapper-aware

#
# ── FAILURE-DIRECTION ROWS — add these whenever the hook derives state from the
#    command text (a path, a repo, a target). They assert the hook still behaves
#    when it CANNOT resolve what it parsed. Omit them and a fail-open bug looks
#    exactly like a clean pass (pitfall #10).
#    ⚠️ These rows expect 2 because this template targets the TOKEN-MATCHER
#    class (the banned thing is right there in the command text). A STATE-
#    DERIVING guard (does staged state span domains?) has the OPPOSITE correct
#    answer for `cd ~/no-such-dir && …` — the && short-circuits, nothing ever
#    runs, allow is correct. Derive your expected exits from SKILL.md rule 5's
#    guard-class table BEFORE writing the row, or you'll fail a correct guard.
# run "trigger behind cd ~"  '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"cd ~/somewhere && TRIGGER -x"}}' 2
# run "trigger behind cd abs" '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"cd /tmp && TRIGGER -x"}}' 2
# run "unresolvable path"    '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"cd ~/no-such-dir && TRIGGER -x"}}' 2
#
# ── CONTENT ROWS — assert the MESSAGE, when the message is the product ────────
# run rows prove the hook decided correctly; says rows prove it said the right
# thing. Both polarities on conditional paragraphs (pitfall #14):
# says "explains alternative" '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"TRIGGER x"}}' "USE INSTEAD" yes
# says "quiet on healthy"     '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"ls -la"}}'    "BLOCKED"     no
#
# ── PROVE THE SUITE CAN FAIL (mutation) — do this once per assertion you add ──
# A green suite carries ZERO information until you have watched it go red for the
# right reason. For each assertion, copy the hook, inject the exact bug that
# assertion claims to catch, and confirm THAT row dies — ideally only that one:
#     cp "$HOOK" /tmp/mutant.sh
#     # invert a branch condition / delete a fact-check / revert to a display-string match
#     bash test_hook.sh /tmp/mutant.sh     # expect exactly the intended row to FAIL
# If the mutant still passes, the assertion is decorative — it is testing something
# other than what its label claims. Two real bugs once lived in a hook through a
# fully green 24-case suite because every row looked only at exit codes.
#
# ── HUMAN-GATE ROWS — if the hook releases via a confirmation dialog / tty YES,
#    force both channels to decline so the run stays headless, and assert it
#    BLOCKS. Requires the hook to read its channels from overridable names
#    (see Pattern B "Make the gate testable"):
#      GIT_GUARD_OSASCRIPT=false GIT_GUARD_TTY=/dev/null bash test_hook.sh <hook>
#    Never provide an env var that *grants* approval — that recreates the retired
#    static-escape-hatch anti-pattern.
#
# ── AFTER-REMEDIATION ROWS (mechanism 2 / receipt-shaped) — required whenever the
#    hook DEMANDS something (rule 7).
#    Point-in-time fixtures are structurally blind to non-termination: each `run`
#    row asks "given this event, fire or not?", while non-termination is a property
#    of the SEQUENCE. This pair is the only row type that can see it.
#    A plain `run` line is NOT enough — the state the hook judges lives OUTSIDE the
#    JSON (on the filesystem), so the rows need setup/teardown around them:
#
#      EVT='{"last_assistant_message":"…text that triggers the demand…"}'
#      RECEIPT="…"                       # ← MUST be the key YOUR hook computes
#      rm -f "$RECEIPT";  run "demands R (no receipt)"       "$EVT" 2
#      : > "$RECEIPT";    run "quiet after R (receipt present)" "$EVT" 0
#      rm -f "$RECEIPT"
#
#    ⚠️ FIRST prove your RECEIPT string is the one the hook actually computes —
#    temporarily `echo "$RECEIPT" >&2` inside the hook, run one case, and compare.
#    There is no universal key: rule 7's sample hook uses `git rev-parse HEAD`,
#    a content-keyed guard hashes the reviewed text, yours may use neither. Copying
#    a key from an example is the most likely reason row 2 fails.
#    ONLY after the paths match does the diagnosis below apply: if row 2 STILL
#    returns 2, the predicate is temporal rather than existence-based and it WILL
#    loop in production (pitfall #16) — fix the predicate, not the fixture.
#
#    Other mechanisms need a differently-shaped pair:
#      • mechanism 3 (blocking-cycle ceiling, never advisory delivery): no receipt
#        to touch — feed the SAME event N+1 times
#        and assert the last one is 0. `rm -f "$CNT"` before AND after, or a stale
#        counter makes the whole suite pass/fail depending on run history.
#      • mechanism 1 (PreToolUse gate): the second row isn't "receipt present", it
#        is "the world now satisfies the demand" — same command, state fixed.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ── EVENT SHAPES OTHER THAN PreToolUse (the payload differs per event) ────────
# A hook reads a DIFFERENT field depending on which event it's registered for.
# Feed the wrong shape and the hook can't find any text, exits 0 silently, and
# EVERY case looks like it passed. Verified shapes (2026-07-22):
#
#   Stop / SubagentStop — hook reads the assistant's final message:
#     run "stop-trigger" '{"last_assistant_message":"...text under test..."}' 2
#     (fallback path: '{"transcript_path":"/abs/path.jsonl"}' where the file has a
#      line {"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]}})
#     REQUIRED anti-loop row for every blocking Stop hook — the one field that
#     bounds re-entry (Pattern E); the hook must exit 0 on it:
#       run "stop_hook_active" '{"stop_hook_active":true,"last_assistant_message":"...trigger text..."}' 0
#     And if the guard can find MULTIPLE violations in one reply: a
#     two-violations row asserting BOTH appear in stderr — the blocked retry
#     round passes unreported findings permanently (pitfall #17). Use two
#     clearly distinct tokens (TRIGGER2 CONTAINS "TRIGGER" — a substring-style
#     detector would make this row pass for the wrong reason):
#       says "reports all hits" '{"last_assistant_message":"TRIGGER and SECONDHIT"}' "SECONDHIT" yes
#
#   UserPromptSubmit — hook reads the user's prompt:
#     run "prompt-trigger" '{"prompt":"...text under test..."}' 2
#
#   PostToolUse — same as PreToolUse plus the result:
#     run "post" '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"x"},"tool_response":{...}}' 2
#
# Build the JSON with single quotes as above. Writing '{\"a\":1}' inside single
# quotes emits LITERAL backslash-quote — invalid JSON — and the hook exits 0 on
# the parse failure, which reads as "passed". (Cost a real debugging round.)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
