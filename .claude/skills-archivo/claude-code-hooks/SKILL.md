  Writes, tests, registers and debugs Claude Code hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart,
  Stop) that turn a rule the model keeps breaking into a hard gate. Use when the user wants to block
  or intercept a tool call, add a guard rail, fix a misfiring hook, or says 拦截 / 守卫 / 钩子 — including

# Claude Code Hooks

Claude Code fires **hooks** at tool-call boundaries. A hook is a shell command
that receives a JSON event on stdin and, for blocking hooks, decides via its
**exit code** whether the tool call proceeds. This is the only mechanism that
*structurally* stops a behavior — a prose rule in CLAUDE.md is a suggestion the
completion drive can override; a hook is a wall.

## When a hook is the right tool (and when it isn't)

Write a hook when **a rule keeps getting violated even though it's already
written down**. The tell: you added the prose rule, it read clearly, and the
behavior recurred anyway — because at the moment of action, attention is 100%
on "get the thing done" and the reminder loses. That recurrence is the signal
to move the rule from prose (advisory) to a hook (enforced). Governance rule of
thumb: *Tier-0 irreversible action + only prose, no hook → it should be a hook.*
(**Tier-0** here = an action whose damage cannot be undone from inside the session:
destroying uncommitted work, pushing secrets to a remote, deleting files, publishing
something outward. The test is reversibility, not severity.)

Do **not** reach for a hook when: the rule has never actually recurred (don't
pre-build guards for hypothetical mistakes — cost with no proven benefit), or
the "rule" is a judgment call with no mechanical signature (a hook can only
match tokens/patterns; it can't judge whether a design is good).

If the symptom is “it keeps reviewing / waiting / retrying,” do not assume the
answer is another hook. First complete the **Loop Contract** in rule 7 and read
[pitfall #36](references/hook_pitfalls.md#36-a-self-applied-review-rule-can-loop-without-any-hook).
The loop may be created entirely by an agent repeatedly applying a prose rule.

## Hook types and what the exit code means

| Type | Fires | Exit 0 | Exit 2 | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PreToolUse** | before a tool runs | normal permission flow unless JSON supplies allow/deny/ask | **block** the call even when JSON says `allow`; read valid JSON fields (v2.1.214+). JSON blocking reason or stderr → model | without schema-valid JSON, another nonzero exit is a non-blocking error and the call proceeds; with valid JSON, the supported fields decide and that status is ignored. Use exit 0 for structured control. Follow the [official exit-code contract](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#exit-code-output) |
| **PostToolUse** | after a tool ran | quiet **unless it prints a `hookSpecificOutput` JSON on stdout — that is how context injection works, and it happens at exit 0** | feedback to the model (can't un-run the tool) | — |
| **SessionStart** | session begins | proceed | **cannot block** — stderr shows the user a hook-error notice, Claude never sees it, the session starts anyway | **exit 0 anyway**: not because a non-zero would block (it can't), but because anything non-zero puts a `<hook> hook error` in the user's transcript on every single session start. Takes a `matcher` on *how the session started* — `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`, `fork` |
| **Stop** (+ `SubagentStop`) | the model is about to finish responding | let it stop | **block the stop** — forces the model to keep going (stderr → fed back as the reason) | loop safety: the hook checks `stop_hook_active` (necessary, **not** sufficient — rule 7). The harness's consecutive-block ceiling (default 8) is **not** a general backstop — its counter resets on any continuation that executed tools, so it never arrives for a hook whose remediation involves tool calls, which is most of them (#27). Carry your own bound. All Stop hooks for an event run **in parallel** — one block round can carry several hooks' feedback |

- **PreToolUse** is the workhorse for stopping a *tool call* — the types in this
  table are the ones this file teaches, not the complete set of blockable events, and
  the **official** hooks reference (docs.claude.com / code.claude.com, not the
  `references/` files in this bundle — those cover only the types above) now
  lists many more blockable events, including `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreCompact`,
  `TeammateIdle`, and task and config events. If what you need to gate is not a tool
  call, look there before forcing it onto PreToolUse.
  `matcher` selects the tool (`Bash`, `Agent`, `WebFetch`, …) — **and how it is
  matched depends on the characters you use**: a matcher containing only letters,
  digits, `_`, `-`, spaces, `,` and `|` is compared as an **exact string** (or a
  `|`/`,`-separated list of exact strings); anything else is treated as an
  **unanchored JavaScript regex**. Both directions bite silently — `Edit.*` also
  matches `NotebookEdit` (anchor it `^Edit$`), while `mcp__memory` matches **nothing**
  because it is all exact-match characters and no tool is named exactly that (you
  want `mcp__memory__.*`). Matching is case-sensitive. Exit 2 blocks and
  the hook's **stderr** becomes the message the model sees — so put the *why* and
  the *correct alternative* there, not just "blocked".
- **PostToolUse** can't undo, but it can **inject authoritative context** so a
  later hallucination can't stand (e.g. re-read the real git HEAD after a commit
  and surface it — the model can't "believe it committed" against injected truth).
- **SessionStart** is for **bounded deployment and liveness probes of the guard rails themselves** —
  silent when healthy, warn on breakage, always exit 0. Note *why*: it is not that
  a non-zero exit would block the session (it cannot), but that it would print a
  hook-error notice at every session start until someone fixes it — a check that
  cries wolf on startup is a check people learn to scroll past. Run the full
  regression battery after edits in the build/commit check, not at session start.
  Invoke only owner-declared bounded offline liveness modes at startup; missing
  modes leave logic unknown/incomplete, without falling back to `--selftest`
  (build order step 4; pitfall #50).
- **`set -euo pipefail` vs `set -uo pipefail` — pick by contract, and know there
  are two ways to keep an always-exit-0 contract.** A hook that may block
  (PreToolUse) wants `-e`: an unexpected failure aborting the script is
  survivable, because the caller treats a non-0/2 exit as "proceed". A hook whose
  contract is **ALWAYS exit 0** (PostToolUse injectors, SessionStart checks) has
  two honest shapes: (a) **drop `-e`** and `||`-guard every risky command —
  with `-e` on, one `grep` that legitimately finds nothing kills the hook
  mid-way and the CLI surfaces a bare `Failed with non-blocking status code`
  (pitfall #8, Pattern E's shape); or (b) **keep `-e` and add `trap 'exit 0' ERR`**
  so any failure still converts to exit 0 while `-e` keeps guarding the plumbing
  (`git-commit-headcheck`'s production shape, Pattern D). Either is correct;
  what you cannot do is `-e` alone with no trap and no `||`-guards. Rule of
  thumb: **`-e` for hooks that decide; for hooks that report, drop `-e` or trap
  it** (pitfall #8).
- **Stop is the odd one out, and the one most often reached for by mistake**:
  it's the *only* hook type that can react to what the model **itself just
  generated** (its own reply text). Every other hook type — including
  `UserPromptSubmit`, which sounds like a plausible place to police "what gets
  said" — only ever sees the **user's** input; it structurally cannot see the
  model's own *current-turn* output (that claim holds — this is still the
  right reason to route such a rule to Stop). That guarantee, however, does
  not extend to proving the `.prompt` field always originated from a
  keystroke: a background task-notification's own report text can populate
  it too, and so can a teammate's or another session's message — no field in
  the stdin JSON marks the difference, only the wrapper tag the text opens
  with — #30. A rule like "the model must not invent a shorthand name
  for something it hasn't verified" belongs on Stop; put it on
  `UserPromptSubmit` instead and it will (a) never once catch what it was
  built for, since that text never flows through that event, and (b)
  false-block the user's own unrelated typing whenever it happens to contain
  the trigger pattern. This is a category mistake, not a tuning problem — no
  amount of regex refinement on the wrong event fixes it. Full contract
  (`last_assistant_message` vs `transcript_path`, the anti-loop check) in
  Pattern E in [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).
- **Stop has two block channels with identical loop protections — pick by
  intent, and make the first (only) block carry everything.** `decision:
  "block"` + `reason`, or plain exit 2 + stderr, shows as a hook *error* — for
  hard gates ("this must not stand"). `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`
  shows as neutral "Stop hook feedback" with no error notification — for
  coaching and reminders the model should weigh, not gates. Both count toward
  the same consecutive-block ceiling from the table above, so the choice is
  tone, not safety. What that means for message design: a blocked retry
  round (`stop_hook_active: true`) is let through **with whatever violations
  remain** — so a Stop guard gets exactly **one** informed bite. (The ceiling
  reinforces this only when your remediation is "rewrite the reply"; if it
  involves tool calls the counter resets and the ceiling never lands — #27.
  Either way the one-bite conclusion holds, because it rests on the latch, not
  on the ceiling.) Report *all* findings in that
  one block (a guard that prints only the first loses the rest permanently —
  pitfall #17), and write the message as an escape manual naming the exact
  acceptable fix, not a verdict — the model converges in one round or it burns
  the cap guessing. v2.1.145+ inputs `background_tasks` / `session_crons` let a
  blocking hook tell "the session is done" from "the session is merely paused
  waiting for background work" — blocking a pause forces pointless
  continuations and wastes the same cap.

Full runnable skeletons: [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).

## The skeleton (PreToolUse Bash guard)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS= read -rd '' INPUT || true                 # builtin; NOT $(cat) — see below
# 0-fork fast path: a builtin `case` on the raw JSON, BEFORE paying for python3.
# Your guard runs on EVERY matching tool call, so the irrelevant path is the one
# that has to be cheap. Keep this filter BROADER than what you actually block and
# never flag-level — it answers "is this even about X", nothing finer (#22).
case "$INPUT" in *TRIGGER*) ;; *) exit 0 ;; esac
TOOL=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_name',''))" 2>/dev/null||echo "")
[ "$TOOL" != "Bash" ] && exit 0                # only guard the tool you mean to
CMD=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('tool_input',{}).get('command',''))" 2>/dev/null||echo "")
[ -z "$CMD" ] && exit 0
printf '%s' "$CMD" | grep -qw 'TRIGGER' || exit 0   # precise relevance check
# ... precise detection here ...
if <command actually does the banned thing>; then
  echo "BLOCKED: ... WHY ... USE INSTEAD: ..." >&2   # stderr = the guidance shown
  exit 2
fi
exit 0
```

**Why the first two lines are not stylistic.** `INPUT=$(cat)` plus each
`printf … | python3 -c …` costs forks **on every call this hook matches, including
the ones it has nothing to say about**. A fleet of ~13 Bash-matcher hooks × parallel
sessions × sub-second tool cadence turned that into a sustained 40–200 forks/sec of
pure guard overhead and put Gatekeeper at the top of an all-day CPU ranking with no
runaway process anywhere — the fleet was fine; the *irrelevant path's* per-call cost
was the bug (#22, with the per-guard conversion recipe and its measured floor).

Check these caveats before copying the `case` line — the first one is the
difference between a fast path and a bypass:

- **A coarse filter must be a SUPERSET of what you block, and a raw substring test
  is not one.** `TRIG''GER -x` runs `TRIGGER` — bash splices the quotes away before
  execution — but the raw event text contains no `TRIGGER` substring, so a bare
  `case "$INPUT" in *TRIGGER*)` exits 0 and the guard never sees it. **Measured**:
  drop this exact line into the shipped Pattern A and `TRIG''GER -x` flips from
  exit 2 to exit 0, a full bypass — while `scripts/test_hook.sh` still reports
  21 pass / 0 fail, because no row carries a spliced trigger. Pattern A already
  carries the fix and the reason ("de-splice — strip quotes and backslashes — and
  check again; a false negative is a full bypass"); a coarse filter placed *before*
  that de-splice makes it unreachable. Two safe shapes, in order of preference:
  **filter on something the splice cannot touch** — a JSON key or a tool name
  (`case "$INPUT" in *'"tool_name":"Bash"'*)`), since quote-splicing lives in the
  *command* text and cannot rewrite the event's own structure; or **de-splice
  inside the filter** before testing (strip `"`, `'` and `\` from a copy of the
  input, then match). Prefer the first: it needs no escaping gymnastics, and a
  filter whose own quoting you have to get right is a filter you can get wrong
  silently. The skeleton above is safe
  as written only because its own detection is likewise a plain word match; the
  moment the guard below the filter is smarter than the filter, the filter decides.

- **This skeleton is fail-open on irrelevance** (`grep -qw … || exit 0`), so a
  coarse filter in front of it changes cost, not semantics. **A fail-closed guard is
  different**: a bare substring filter silently converts its contract from
  block-unknown to allow-unknown (measured — `'not json'` sailed straight through the
  first cut of that fix), and a `*tool_name*` marker alone re-opens the same hole from
  the other side. Read #22's gate requirements *before* fitting a fast path to a guard
  that is supposed to block on malformed input.
- **There is a cheaper layer above the script.** A hook handler can carry an
  `if` field in its registration — permission-rule syntax such as `"Bash(git *)"` —
  and the hook command **does not run at all** when it doesn't match: zero forks,
  because zero processes. It is best-effort by design (the docs say it fails *open*,
  running your hook anyway, when the Bash command can't be parsed), so treat it as a
  cost optimization and **never as the gate** — the in-script check still decides.
  Check its limits: it holds exactly one rule (no `&&`/`||`), it is only evaluated
  on tool events, and a hook that sets `if` on a non-tool event **never runs at all**.

## Rules that separate a working guard from a session-poisoning one

Not style preferences — each is a specific failure we shipped and traced back.

### 1. Match at the **token level with shlex**, never awk-split the raw string

A guard that **false-blocks a healthy command is worse than one that misses** —
a guard people must bypass gets bypassed reflexively, and then it protects
nothing (the core discipline: *误杀健康输入比漏报更糟*). The recurring cause of
false-blocks is matching on the raw command string.


- **Wrong**: `awk '{gsub(/&&|\|\||;|\|/,"\n")}'` to split into segments — awk
  doesn't understand shell quoting, so `grep -E "a|TRIGGER|b"` gets split at the
  `|` *inside the quoted regex*, `TRIGGER` becomes a phantom command, and the
  guard blocks a plain grep. (Shipped 2026-07-21; the guard's very first real use
  was a false-block on my own grep.)
- **Right**: tokenize the whole command with the **`shlex.shlex` class**, not the
  `shlex.split()` function — `split()` only treats `| ; & < >` as separators when
  they are space-separated, so `ls|TRIGGER x` tokenizes to `['ls|TRIGGER', 'x']` and
  your command-position check never sees `TRIGGER` at all (measured; the class with
  `punctuation_chars=True` yields `['ls', '|', 'TRIGGER', 'x']`). Copy a shipped
  walker verbatim rather than reaching for the one-liner — but **copy the one that
  passes `scripts/test_hook.sh`**, which is **Pattern A's**. The
  [walker section](references/hook_patterns.md#the-shlex-command-position-walker) is
  a *compact* form and says so: it omits the per-wrapper valued-flag tables, so it
  misses a target riding a **valued-flag wrapper** — measured, it returns "not in
  command position" for `timeout 5 TRIGGER`, `sudo -u root TRIGGER` and
  `nice -n 10 TRIGGER`, while Pattern A's version catches all three. (Bare
  `sudo TRIGGER` is fine in both — it is the wrapper's *own* flag taking an argument
  that the compact table doesn't know to skip.) Only one of those shapes is in the
  shipped harness, so the run you actually see is **20 pass / 1 fail on
  `wrapper-timeout`** against 21/0 for Pattern A's; the other two fail silently
  because no row covers them. A quoted
  `"a|TRIGGER|b"` stays **one token**, so a regex argument is never mistaken for
  a command. Then check whether your target is in a **command position**
  (token[0], or right after a `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|` separator, skipping `VAR=val`
  env-assignment prefixes). Command-position walker in
  [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).
- Corollary: `echo "…TRIGGER…"`, `grep TRIGGER`, `# TRIGGER`, `man TRIGGER` must
  all pass. Your test set MUST include these mention-not-execute cases.
- **Corollary — exempt `git` write segments before they reach the walker.** A
  commit message is arbitrary data, and the whole message text reaches your
  command-position walk as pseudo-command-text — `git commit -F - <<EOF` with a
  body quoting `foo|TRIGGER` lands `TRIGGER` in command position, and the guard
  blocks its own fix commit (pitfall #7 is exactly this, shipped). Any Bash guard
  that inspects command strings must skip segments whose head is `git` +
  `commit`/`rebase`/`tag`/`am`/`cherry-pick` — and do it at the whole-command
  level, before any line splitting (Pattern A shows the order; the production
  version is `lib-git-commit-detect`'s adjacency check).
- **Corollary — the walker is two-stage for a reason.** `whitespace_split=True`
  treats newlines as ordinary whitespace, so a multiline block
  (`cd /x\ngit add\nTRIGGER -y`) collapses into one segment headed by `cd` and
  the trigger is never in command position — replayed trigger rate 0 on real
  transcripts (pitfall #11). Split into lines **shell-aware** first (quote state
  and backslash continuations honored, so quoted multiline strings don't
  fragment), then shlex-walk each line — both Pattern A and the walker section
  ship that splitter (`split_shell_lines`, production-proven in qlmanage-guard).
  What even it cannot parse is a heredoc body (not quote syntax); when to accept
  that residual is #11's call.
- **But shlex isn't a silver bullet, and *what* you detect changes whether
  fail-open is safe.** `shlex.split()` itself throws `ValueError` on an unbalanced
  quote — a multi-line `git commit -m "…` message with a `#` or an unclosed quote
  is the classic trigger. The `except ValueError: cmd.split()` fallback then
  *allows*, which is right when you're detecting a **banned modifier** (does this
  carry `--no-verify`? — missing it errs safe, Rule 1's direction), but
  **dangerous when you're detecting whether the command IS your target at all**
  (is this a `git commit`? — a ValueError there means the guard never recognises
  the commit and silently doesn't fire; a real cross-domain commit shipped with no
  confirmation dialog this way). For the *is-this-the-command* decision, prefer a
  narrow **regex** (`git` and `commit` as separate words, any flag tokens between)
  that's immune to multi-line-quote breakage; reserve the shlex walker for the
  *command-position / modifier* checks where fail-open is the safe direction.
  (The boundary: regex when the predicate is "is this a specific common command
  at all" — `git commit`, `git push` — whose own message/arguments are what breaks
  tokenizing; walker when the predicate is "is a *banned* command or modifier in
  command position" — there the banned thing is rare and a ValueError fail-open
  errs safe, Rule 1's direction.)

### 2. Test with **bash -n + a real JSON event, end-to-end, BEFORE registering**

**A corrupted or wrong-logic PreToolUse hook poisons the *entire* session** —
every later Bash call gets truncated / duplicated / falsely-failed / looks
hallucinated-executed, and you'll blame "the environment" when it's the hook you
just installed. (2026-07-05: a `[^;&|]` regex broke in one edit, `;&` became a
bash case-fallthrough token, poisoned half a session until `bash -n` found it.)
"My tests passed at deploy" isn't enough — the file can corrupt in a *later* edit.

Gate before registering ANY hook:
```bash
bash -n hook.sh                                # syntax
printf '%s' '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"<trigger case>"}}'    | ./hook.sh; echo "exit=$?"  # want 2
printf '%s' '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"<healthy lookalike>"}}'| ./hook.sh; echo "exit=$?"  # want 0
```
Run the end-to-end case in the **verbatim form the registration will use** —
if settings.json will say `$HOME/.claude/hooks/x.sh`, execute exactly that string.
Any interpreter-explicit form (`bash hook.sh`, `python3 hook.py`, and a hook's own
`--selftest` that re-invokes itself through `bash`) bypasses the exec bit, so it
structurally cannot catch a dead-on-arrival registration. Symptom index: a
repeating non-blocking `PreToolUse hook error: … Permission denied` after install
means a bare-path-registered hook lost its exec bit — **the gate has been dead
since install**; a green selftest is not evidence against this, because the
selftest never exercised the registered form.
Bundle the harness: [scripts/test_hook.sh](scripts/test_hook.sh) runs a whole
table of trigger/allow cases. **Self-block gotcha:** once the hook is live in the
session you cannot test it by putting the trigger string in your *own* Bash
command — the live hook blocks your test command. Put the cases in a **script
file** and run `bash test_hook.sh`; the outer command doesn't contain the
trigger, so it isn't self-blocked.

**Once a hook has caused one real incident (a false-block or a silent miss),
solo re-reading the code is not enough** — a same-day rewrite of a Stop-hook
guard was itself re-broken twice by the author while fixing the first bug (a
quote inside a Python comment, invisible on re-read, only surfaced by running
the actual failing JSON case). The escalation is a multi-lens agent-team
review where every finding must be reproduced by *executing* a real payload
against the live script, not by reading the code and agreeing — this is the
general Counter Review methodology
(skill-creator's `skill-development-methodology` reference, Phase 6), applied to
a hook instead of a skill. In one such pass, 3 lenses (matching
logic / shell-embedding safety / event-contract robustness) surfaced 13
confirmed, independently-reproduced bugs and 1 finding whose own cited
evidence turned out to be a hallucinated doc quote — caught only because the
verifier was required to curl the raw source and grep for the exact string
rather than trust the citation.

### 3. Installer-owned source, installation and recovery

Keep the entrypoint and its rule modules in version-controlled source. Use the
owning installer's current entry map for installation and recovery; a rule module
does not need its own link or registration. When that installer uses symlinks,
the layout is:
```
~/scripts/claude-hooks/<name>.sh      # SSOT (this setup: a private git repo)
~/.claude/hooks/<name>.sh             # symlink → SSOT

```
After a reinstall, restore only the entries the current installer declares active;
do not reconstruct registrations from old filenames or reinstall retired aliases.
Preserve independent rule state and authorization writers when migrating entries.
Verify the consumed entrypoint, modules and effective settings, then exercise a
real matching event in a fresh native session. A dangling link can silently disarm
a guard; use bounded deployment/liveness checks (rule 4; Pattern C in
[references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md)).

### 4. Registration is per-profile — converge ALL profiles, release via a HUMAN gate

- **There are two registration surfaces, and the health check probably only
  watches one.** Besides the profile settings below, a repo's own
  `.claude/settings.json` (and `settings.local.json`) registers hooks for
  sessions in that repo. Those live outside `~/.claude/hooks/`, so a guard-rail
  check that walks that directory covers none of them — syntax, path,
  `--selftest`, nothing. Two silent failures shipped in one such file and
  survived two months under a SessionStart health check built to prevent
  exactly that (#38, #39). Register project hooks by **absolute** path — a
  relative one resolves against the session cwd and breaks the first time
  someone starts `claude` from a subdirectory — and extend the health check to
  walk up from the event's cwd for project settings.
- A hook in `~/.claude/hooks/` protects **nothing** if the *active profile's*
  `settings.json` doesn't call it. Multi-profile users ran with zero guards until
  every profile was converged. Use the owning installer to update the **main** profile's settings
  (`~/.claude/settings.json` in this setup; the Registration section of
  [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md) has the exact jsonc
  shape). Update an existing engine's matcher only when its coverage changes;
  preserve each rule's narrower internal selector. In this
  setup the converger is registered as a SessionStart hook **without arguments**
  (`sync-profile-settings.py`, owned by the `claude-switch-models-setup` skill),
  so the next profile to start a session carries the registration into every
  profile. `--all` is the explicit convergence mode; run it when immediate
  profile synchronization is needed, without treating that write as activation proof.
  A SessionStart health check greps each profile for the Tier-0 guards to
  catch drift. For new or changed registrations, verify a real matching event
  and debug evidence in a fresh native session. Claim current-session hot reload
  only after observing that session invoke the changed registration; a successful
  settings write or startup health line alone is insufficient. The current
  [ConfigChange contract](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#configchange)
  allows settings changes to be applied to a running session; it does not prove
  this particular registration has fired.
- **If the guard needs a release valve, make it a *human* gate, not an env var.**
  A static `GUARD_OK=1` escape hatch is no gate — the model can set the env var
  itself. Use a native macOS dialog (`osascript` — the model can't click);
  refuse/cancel/timeout = hard NO; log every prompt/bypass to an audit file.
  Pattern in [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).
  - ⚠️ **`/dev/tty` is not a second channel — the docs say hooks cannot open it.**
    This file used to prescribe a typed `YES` on `/dev/tty` alongside the dialog.
    The official reference is explicit: hooks "run in their own session **without a
    controlling terminal**", and "the hook process and any child processes **can't
    open `/dev/tty`**" (`terminalSequence` is the documented replacement for writing
    to it). So a "two-channel" gate built that way is one channel plus dead code,
    and on a box with no GUI session the gate can never be approved by anyone.
    Consistent with local observation, though read the boundary carefully: in one
    setup's shared audit log — 1,801 entries, several guards writing to it, three of
    which implement a tty channel — **360 lines carry a channel tag (236 dialog
    confirmations, 124 declines or timeouts) and not one line of any kind names the
    tty channel.** That means the tty branch was never *entered*, which on macOS is
    what you would predict anyway, because the dialog answers first and short-
    circuits it. So the log shows nothing here ever depended on tty; it is the
    documentation, not this measurement, that establishes tty cannot work at all.
    Keep the dialog; if you need a non-macOS gate,
    you need a channel this file does not yet have a verified answer for.
  - ⚠️ **A human gate that outlives the hook timeout fails OPEN.** Hook `command`
    timeout defaults to 600s (30s on `UserPromptSubmit`), and a timed-out hook
    **does not block the tool call** — so an unanswered dialog does not become a
    "no", it becomes an allow. Bound your wait well under the timeout and make
    no-answer resolve to block *yourself*, before the harness resolves it for you.
  - ⚠️ **A human gate is only worth raising where its dialog can carry the decision.**
    The person sees what the hook puts in the box and nothing else — so on a path
    where the hook's own evidence is empty (it reads state *before* the command runs,
    and this command creates that state), the dialog is empty too, and what comes
    back is a reflexive click, not a judgement. On those paths block mechanically and
    tell the model how to restructure the command so the state becomes observable;
    keep the dialog for paths that can name the target, the command and the objects.
    Whatever model-authored text the dialog shows (command, paths) gets
    whitespace-folded first. Symptom, fix and the recorder-stub calibration:
    [references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md) #44.
  - ⚠️ **The remedy you print instead has to be executable — prove it by running it.**
    Where the hook blocks mechanically, the `stderr` instruction is the whole product of
    that interception, and a string folded for display (above) is not one the model can
    paste back. Test each printed remedy the only way that counts: assemble the exact
    bytes, run them, drive the same event through the hook again, assert it now passes.
    That some *other* parser decodes the string is not evidence — the checkpoint is the
    gate's own tokenizer. [references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md) #45.
  - The docs also carry an in-UI channel — PreToolUse `hookSpecificOutput`
    `permissionDecision: "ask"`, which prompts through Claude Code's own interface.
    It is worth knowing about, but **unverified here under `bypassPermissions` /
    auto-accept**, which is precisely the mode a Tier-0 gate must survive; the
    dialog is prescribed because it does not depend on permission mode.
  - **Below Tier-0, where a model-serviceable escape *is* allowed, make it the
    correct usage rather than a bypass flag.** The rule above is absolute for Tier-0
    and does not bend here — this is about the correctness guards that fall short of
    it, which still need a way out for the legitimate case the detector cannot
    distinguish. The question is what you make that way out *be*. A `SKIP=1` /
    `--force` env escape trains exactly the reflex rule 1 warns about, and under
    deadline it is indistinguishable from a bypass. Prefer an escape that is **the
    thing you wanted them to do anyway**, so taking it improves the command instead of
    disarming the guard: `pipe-fallback-guard` exits 0 the moment the command mentions
    `pipefail` / `PIPESTATUS` / `pipestatus`, because an author who wrote any of those
    has already demonstrated they understand pipeline exit codes — the guard has
    nothing left to teach them. The test to apply: *if someone takes my escape hatch,
    is the resulting command better, or merely unblocked?* If the honest answer is
    "merely unblocked", you have a bypass flag with a nicer name. Sibling principle
    for the Tier-0 case, where the override exists only so the gate can be tested:
    **the escape hatch may only make the gate stricter** — see the `GIT_GUARD_TEST`
    discussion in [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md).

### 5. Decide the failure **direction**, and test *that* — not just the happy path

Rule 1 ranked *detection-tuning* errors: given that the guard ran, false-blocking a
healthy command beats missing a rare bad one, because a guard people must bypass
gets bypassed reflexively. **This rule is about a different axis — the guard's
machinery not running at all** — so "which is worse" is not being reversed here;
the two rankings never meet. A tuning miss costs you one case; this costs you the
guard, silently, on every input of that shape.

The failure: the guard **cannot obtain the thing it judges on** — a parse throws, a path doesn't
resolve, a dependency is missing, a subprocess times out — and the very
`2>/dev/null || true` that stops the hook from crashing quietly converts *"I could
not check"* into *"nothing to report."* The hook exits 0. **That output is identical
to a real pass**, which is why this survives for weeks.

So at every point where the hook *obtains* something (parses the command, reads
staged files, queries a service), decide explicitly: **if this comes back empty, does
that mean allow or block?** — and write the answer next to the branch. Fail-open is
often right for a *modifier* check (does this carry `--no-verify`? missing it costs
you one case). Fail-closed is usually right for the *is-this-even-the-thing* check
(is this a cross-domain commit? an empty answer means the guard never fired at all).

**Then test the direction, not the happy path**: hand it an unresolvable path or an
unparseable command on purpose and assert it still does what you decided. A suite
where every row passes *because the hook silently allowed everything* is
indistinguishable from a suite that passes.

**Read those results carefully — the same input has opposite correct answers for
different guard classes.** Take `cd ~/no-such-dir && TRIGGER`:

| Guard class | Judges on | Correct exit | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Token matcher** (is this a banned command form?) | the command text alone | **2, block** | `TRIGGER` is right there in the text; an unresolvable `cd` doesn't make it not-a-trigger, and if the guard goes quiet here it will also go quiet on `cd ~/real-dir && TRIGGER` |
| **State deriver** (does the repo's staged set span domains?) | state read from disk | **0, allow** | `cd` fails, `&&` short-circuits, no commit ever happens — there is nothing to guard |
| **Termination-state reader** (has the remediation already happened?) | a receipt / counter file (rule 7) | **0, allow** — *when the state file IS the termination condition* | an unreadable receipt means the hook cannot know it already fired; failing closed here blocks forever with no remediation possible and no human-visible cause — that *is* the loop, and it is the one failure worse than a missed case. **Inverted sub-case — read this before copying the row:** when the state is only a **budget on top of an independent predicate** (the block still clears by doing the work), allow-on-unreadable **silently disables the entire hook** — one unwritable directory makes it mute for every input, forever, which is the worst failure shape there is. There, fail back to *the behavior before the budget existed* (keep evaluating the predicate), not to silence. **Tell the two apart with one question: if the state vanished, would remediation still be possible?** No → receipt case, allow. Yes → budget case, keep checking. Worked answers, so nobody has to re-derive them: rule 7's mechanism 2 (receipt) **and** mechanism 3 (per-session counter) are both **receipt case → allow** — mechanism 3 is deliberately blind to whether R happened, so its counter is the only exit and muting it strands the turn. The budget case is a counter layered on a predicate the user can still satisfy on its own |

So decide which class your hook is *before* writing the row, and the harness's
`unresolvable path` template row expects **2** because that template targets the
token-matcher class. Getting this backwards produces a confident FAIL against a
correct guard. For a state-deriving guard the failure you are hunting is: **the command would really
have run and the guard didn't see it** — an unbalanced quote makes tokenizing throw,
the fallback allows, and a genuine cross-domain commit ships with no dialog (rule 1's
ValueError note). Ask of every allowed row: *would this command actually have done
the thing?* If no, the allow is correct.

Running this exact probe against a real state-deriving guard returned two allows on
the first pass: one was correct (the short-circuit above) and one was a genuine
fail-open. **The probe finds things; you still have to classify what it found** —
which is why the class table above comes before the rows.

Real case (2026-07-22): a scope guard read staged files via `git -C "$REPO_DIR"`
with `REPO_DIR` parsed out of the **command text** — so `cd ~/repo && git commit`
handed it a literal `~/repo`, `git -C` failed, staged came back empty, and the guard
concluded "no cross-domain files, allow." Every cross-repo commit went unguarded and
nothing ever looked wrong. Anatomy + the shared-library twist: pitfall #10.

That parser has a second failure direction, and it is the nastier one. Once you
add a fallback so it stops failing open, the fallback becomes correct for one
reason and wrong for another — and both print the same line. `git push` (no
explicit target) legitimately falls back to the event's `cwd`; `git -C "$R" push`
*names* a target the hook cannot resolve, falls back to the same `cwd`, and then
renders a confident ✅ about a different repository. Those two cases render
byte-identically (measured, MD5-equal), so neither the hook nor the reader can
tell the honest verdict from the misbound one. **A fallback value must carry the reason it was
chosen**, and only "no explicit target" earns a verdict. Full anatomy, the
confused-deputy framing, and why fixtures with literal paths never catch it:
pitfall #28.

### 6. Judge on a fact the world can answer — never on your own rendering, never on a naming habit

Rules 1 and 5 are about *how* you match and *which way* you fail. This one is
about **where the thing you match on came from**, and it has two failure shapes
that both go silent:

- **Never branch on a string you formatted for a human.** If the hook builds a
  report — sorted, joined, truncated to the first N with a `(+M more)` tail — and
  then pattern-matches its own decision against that report, the branch inherits
  the rendering's losses. Items past the cutoff simply do not exist to it, so the
  branch works on every small fixture and stops firing on exactly the large
  sessions it was built for. Emit the machine fact on its own channel (one
  untruncated `KINDS:a,b,c` line) and match *that*. A rendering is an output, not
  a data source (pitfall #12).
- **Prefer a checkable fact over a naming convention.** Classifying by path shape
  (`/skills?/[^/]+/references/`) encodes one directory layout; a repo laid out any
  other way is classified `None` — silently, forever. The fix is *not* to widen the
  pattern, which trades a silent miss for machine-wide false positives (rule 1
  forbids exactly that trade); it is to ask a question the filesystem can answer —
  *is there a `SKILL.md` beside this `references/` directory?* Facts survive
  layout changes; conventions do not. (When the candidate **is** a `SKILL.md`,
  there is no sibling to ask about — classify by basename; #13 explains why that
  is a spec-defined fact and not the naming habit this rule warns against.)
  **A checkable fact can still be the wrong fact — anchor the question and filter by
  type.** `test -f SKILL.md` is true in a downloads folder too, and one guard that walked
  ancestors looking for exactly that swallowed an entire home directory, then told a real
  session to load a skill named after it — a name that cannot exist (rule 9's incident).
  Anchor to a sibling of a *specific* directory or to a known install path; an unanchored
  ancestor walk is a convention wearing a fact's clothes.

The tell for both: a branch that has never once fired in production while its
tests are green. Print the raw pre-formatting classification and you will see
which of the two you have.

### 7. If the hook **demands remediation**, prove the loop terminates

A hook that **blocks** (exit 2) until X is done — Stop hooks especially, since
they re-fire on every subsequent stop — is not a check, it's a **feedback loop**.
(A hook that merely *injects* a demand and exits 0 has no loop at all: nothing
re-evaluates. That is mechanism 0 below, and it is the right default more often
than people reach for it.)

```
condition T is true → hook demands remediation R → model performs R → T checked again
```

**Write the Loop Contract before the first cycle — for hook-enforced loops and
agent-driven review / wait / retry loops alike:**

```text
LOOP KEY: immutable logical target / lineage + one failure axis
FIRE T: the condition that starts another cycle
REMEDIATION R: the exact action one cycle performs
VARIANT V: the well-founded quantity that strictly decreases for this key
BUDGET: maximum cycles, fixed before cycle 1
SUCCESS EXIT: the observable that proves the axis is clear
CAPPED EXIT: what is left blocked / unshipped / pending when the budget ends
```

No completed contract means no blocking Stop hook and no repeated reviewer or
polling loop. Freeze the key before cycle 1. A remediation snapshot, commit, or
reviewer name stays inside that same lineage and cannot mint a new budget. A
new, unrelated finding is a **new key**: record it separately; it does not reset
this loop's budget. A cycle that cannot name a new falsifying experiment or a
smaller V adds no evidence and stops.

For an **agent-driven independent-review loop**, the default budget is one
initial review plus one narrowly scoped re-review after substantive fixes. A
third reviewer is not automatic. If the re-review still reproduces a BLOCKER or
MAJOR on the same axis, leave the hook unregistered / artifact unshipped, report
the blocked state, and require a new user-authorized task whose Loop Contract
declares its budget before cycle 1. An agent-declared budget cannot authorize
itself. Inside that authorized task, name the concrete safety or business
failure caused by stopping now; optional polish does not qualify.

Filled review-loop example:

```text
LOOP KEY: <initial frozen commit>'s review lineage + termination-contract fidelity
FIRE T: fresh review reports a same-axis BLOCKER / MAJOR
REMEDIATION R: reproduce that finding, apply one bounded fix, run its narrow check
VARIANT V: 2 - completed review cycles
BUDGET: 2 cycles total (initial review + one re-review)
SUCCESS EXIT: no same-axis BLOCKER / MAJOR
CAPPED EXIT: artifact stays unregistered / unshipped; report remaining findings
```

Every repair descendant of the initial frozen commit remains in this key. The
current snapshot changes so the reviewer can inspect the fix; the lineage and
its remaining budget do not.

Nothing mechanically enforces this hookless budget — it holds only while the
agent follows the Skill. That limitation is why the capped exit must be visible
and must never be reported as “completed.”

**If completing R can make T true again, the loop does not converge.** Nothing
errors, nothing crashes; it burns round after round until a human interrupts —
which is what usually happens, because each round is a *complete* remediation
cycle (dispatch, wait, adopt, edit), not a cheap retry. **And that same
property is why the harness's 8-consecutive-block ceiling will not save you:
its counter resets on every continuation that executed tools, so a remediation
cycle made of tool calls keeps it pinned at 1 forever** (measured — #27). Even
where it does arrive, it is a backstop against a runaway session, not a design:
the turn ends with the violation still standing, and the harness reports that
turn as `reason:"completed"` — indistinguishable from genuinely finishing.
"It eventually stops" is not termination in any sense you want, and here it
does not even eventually stop. `stop_hook_active` does *not* save you here — that field covers
exactly **one layer of re-entry** ("the stop I just blocked is being retried").
It says nothing about the *cross-turn* case, where the model genuinely goes off
and does R (real work, many tool calls), then stops naturally: that is a brand
new Stop, the field is `false`, and the hook fires again on the same grounds.

**The test, borrowed from termination proofs in program verification** — a [loop
variant / ranking function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variant): write
down a quantity **V** mapping into a well-founded order (usually just ℕ), and
show that **V strictly decreases across every `trigger → remediate → re-check`
cycle**. No V, no termination proof — don't register the hook.

**V is a design-time obligation, not code** — you never compute it in the hook.
What ships is the *predicate* (the mechanisms below); V is the argument that the
predicate converges. Put it where the next reader will trip over it — the script
header:

```bash
# TERMINATION: V = 1 - exists(<receipt path>)
# decreased by: R writes the receipt; nothing R does afterwards can remove it.
```

Answer the following questions to show it decreases; the answers go in that
comment:

1. **What does R change?** Name the exact file / field / timestamp.
2. **Is that thing an operand of T?** If yes, and R moves it back toward "fire" →
   there is no V.
3. **After R, what is the smallest input that makes T true again?** If the answer
   is "the same input I just fired on" → there is no V. Redesign the predicate;
   do not retune the threshold.

**A real counter-example.** A Stop hook required an independent review before
compounding artifacts (rule files, skills, other hooks) could be pushed:

- **T** (the condition that makes the hook **fire**) = "there are edits no review
  has covered", implemented as the timestamp comparison
  `last_edit > last_review` (`last_edit` = newest mtime across the artifact set,
  `last_review` = mtime of the review record — two single numbers, which is
  exactly what makes the comparison feel safe)
- **R** = dispatch an independent reviewer

But a review that is worth running **has output**: its findings get adopted **by
the same agent, immediately, before it next tries to stop** → that produces new
edits → `last_edit` moves past `last_review` → **T is true again**. (If a human
adopted them later, out of band, there would be no loop — the loop needs the
remediation and the re-check inside one agent's turn, which is exactly what a
Stop hook guarantees.) There is no V — remediation doesn't decrease a quantity, it *resets*
one. The only escape is "review, then change nothing," which is precisely the
case where dispatching the reviewer was pointless. Observed: three consecutive
rounds, each a complete review-and-adopt cycle, exited only by the user saying
stop.

Two things make this hard to see. **The comparison looks perfectly reasonable in
isolation** — "the review must be newer than the last edit" is exactly what you'd
write. And that sentence is the **pass** condition — T is its negation. Copy it
into your head as-is, without that negation, and you are reasoning about the
wrong operand for the rest of the analysis; keep T oriented as the **fire**
condition. (Writing the *code* as an early-exit guard clause — `… && exit 0` — is
normal shell style and not what this is about; the discipline is about which
orientation you reason in. And note equality: same-second mtimes land on the pass
side, i.e. fail-open, which matches what this rule requires of state reads below.) Run the checklist
above and it falls out mechanically: R changes `last_edit` (Q1); `last_edit` is
an operand of T (Q2); the smallest input that re-fires T is the remediation's own
output (Q3) → no V.

**A second failure form: the predicate can't see the remediation at all
(observability gap).** The counter-example above is a temporal predicate that
remediation *moves*. A quieter failure of the same family: remediation happens,
but the channel the predicate reads it through doesn't exist in this
environment. Real case (2026-07-26, found by a full-fleet loop audit): a Stop
hook detected "an independent review happened" by scanning tool_results for
`agentId: <hex>` and reading `subagents/agent-<hex>.jsonl` — correct on the
main profile. Team-mode sessions use a different schema entirely (spawn
receipts `agent_id: <name>@session-<uuid>`, deliveries as `teammate_id`
teammate messages, files `agent-a<name>-<hex>.jsonl`) — zero matches, ever,
so `last_review` stayed `None` forever and every compounding-edit∧push turn
re-fired the demand: a false-positive loop, bounded to one block per stop
sequence but unbounded across turns, and its "2/2 fires" that session were
both on fully-reviewed work. Same family, different medicine: the temporal
loop needs a better *predicate*; the observability loop needs a better
*channel*. Add a fourth question to the checklist — **Q4: in every environment
this hook will run in, can the predicate actually SEE R happen?** For
transcript-reading hooks that means parsing a real session from each
profile/mode, not fixture-testing one schema. (The repair for the case above:
multi-schema detection + teammate deliveries excluded from turn boundaries so
they can't truncate the detection window — pitfall #20.)

**Pick by axis first, then by order.**
0 decides *whether to block at all*; 1 decides *which event to hang it on*; 2–4
are the *predicate's shape* (choose 1 and you still need one of 2–4). The 0→4
order is "how completely the loop is removed", and it runs **inversely to how
much you can enforce** — so take the first one that still gives you the
enforcement you actually need, not simply the first one.

0. **Don't block — inject.** If the demand is advisory (you want the model to
   *consider* R, not to be unable to finish without it), print it and exit 0.
   Nothing re-evaluates, so there is no loop to prove terminating. Right default
   for anything short of Tier-0, and the cost is honest: a reminder can be
   ignored, so say in the header that it is fail-open — rule 4's point stands,
   a gate the subject can walk past is not a gate. If you need a *gate*, use 2
   and pay for the receipt. Injection channel: Pattern D.
   ⚠️ **This option does not exist on Stop** — and rule 7's main subject *is*
   Stop, so read this before reaching for it. On Stop, `exit 0` means "let the
   turn end", so there is no later reasoning step for the text to land in; and
   `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` counts toward the same 8-block ceiling
   as `exit 2` (see the hook-types section), i.e. it is also a block. Stop has
   exactly two modes: gate, or silence. Choosing mechanism 0 on Stop therefore
   means **changing the event** — hang the injection on the tool call that
   produced the artifact (PostToolUse, Pattern D) — or admitting you wanted a
   gate after all, and going to mechanism 2.
   **Keep a recurring advisory available for the whole session.** Limit its
   *rate* with elapsed time, activity thresholds, and a reset after each prompt
   or delivery; do not give it a lifetime per-session count. A lifetime count
   does not reduce burst frequency after the cadence has already done so — it
   changes eventual availability from periodic to permanently silent, usually
   in the longest sessions that need the reminder most. Mechanism 3 below is a
   termination budget for a blocking remediation loop, not a generic anti-spam
   pattern. Test both sides as a sequence: below either cadence threshold stays
   quiet, while the fifth, tenth, or later fully-due window still delivers.
   ⚠️ **"No loop" holds only if R isn't your own matcher's target.** An injector
   on `Bash` that tells the model to run `git ls-remote` fires again on that very
   command, and re-injects. Same shape, softer — the model can ignore it, so
   there is no forced iteration, but it is broadcast-on-repeat rather than
   nothing. Check that the R you recommend is not an action this hook matches.

1. **Move the check to the action boundary.** If what you want to gate is an
   *action* — a push, a publish, a delete — guard **the action** with PreToolUse
   instead of guarding **the turn** with Stop. **Stop-hook remediation loops are
   often action gates attached to the wrong event**, and this is the concrete
   case of "Stop is the odd one out, and the one most often reached for by
   mistake" from the hook-types section.
   **Be precise about what this buys.** PreToolUse only re-fires when the model
   *voluntarily retries the gated action*, and the model can always decline and
   end its turn normally. So it guarantees **the turn terminates** — the worst
   case drops from "the turn can't end" to "this action doesn't happen". It does
   **not** make a non-converging predicate converge: take the counter-example
   above, move it to PreToolUse unchanged, and the loop survives intact (push →
   blocked → review → findings adopted → new edits → retry → `last_edit` is ahead
   again → blocked). That case is sick in its **predicate**, not in its event, so
   you still pick a shape from 2–4. Note also that PreToolUse has **no** harness
   backstop — the 8-block ceiling in the hook-types table is Stop-only — so a
   self-resetting predicate moved here has *fewer* safety nets, not more.
   ⚠️ Two shapes where this mechanism is the wrong answer: **R has to be done
   with the very tool you gated** (a guard on `Edit` demanding you fix a file
   header first — deadlock, nothing can ever satisfy it), and **an action that
   recurs within one session** (a `git push` gate in a session that pushes five
   repos = five full demands; that is the density problem in the war story
   below, and mechanism 1 doesn't exempt you from it).

2. **Make "already remediated" an existence fact, not a temporal one — and key it
   on the thing that needed remediating.** Have R land an artifact and test *does
   it exist*; the key is what makes this work:

   ```bash
   KEY=$(git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null || printf 'nogit')   # or a hash of the
   RECEIPT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/my-guard.${KEY}.ok"              # reviewed content
   [ -f "$RECEIPT" ] && exit 0            # V = 1 - exists, for THIS key
   ```

   `V = 1 - exists` is **per key**: it decreases exactly once per key and can
   never be pushed back up *for that key*. New work mints a *new* key — that is a
   new demand, not a re-arm. Both naive keyings fail: one global path makes the
   hook fire once per machine and then sit dead forever with zero signal, and a
   time-based key is the temporal predicate this rule exists to forbid. **A
   temporal predicate is almost always the wrong shape**, because the remediation
   you demanded is usually what moves the operand you compare against.
   This content-SHA key is correct for a one-shot receipt gate. It does **not**
   redefine an agent-review lineage: commits created by that lineage's
   remediation remain under its original key and original budget.
   ⚠️ If the **model** can create the receipt, this is rule 4's retired
   `GUARD_OK=1` escape hatch wearing a new hat. Have it written by something the
   model doesn't drive (the reviewer subagent's own output file, a git note), or
   accept that the hook is advisory and say so in its header.

3. **A ceiling on blocking remediation cycles — never on recurring advisory
   delivery.** Use at most N demands per session per target only when the hook
   is forcing a bounded loop and the capped exit explicitly leaves the action
   blocked, unshipped, or pending. `session_id` is the stable key for that
   termination budget (it is on every event; see the JSON contract in Pattern
   references):

   ```bash
   SID=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('session_id','nosid'))" 2>/dev/null || echo nosid)
   CNT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/my-guard.${SID}.count"
   N=$(cat "$CNT" 2>/dev/null || echo 0); N=$((N+1)); printf '%s' "$N" > "$CNT"
   if [ "$N" -gt 3 ]; then
     CAPPED_REASON='Loop budget exhausted; the blocked condition remains unresolved. Do not report completed.'
     python3 - "$CAPPED_REASON" <<'PY'
   import json, sys
   print(json.dumps({"continue": False, "stopReason": sys.argv[1]}))
   PY
     exit 0                              # explicit capped stop, not silent success
   fi
   ```

   Crude, and deliberately blind to whether R actually happened — but *finite*,
   which is the property that was missing. Do **not** substitute `$$` or `$PPID`:
   each hook run is a fresh process, so those change every invocation and the
   counter never accumulates. Print the count ("reminder 2 of 3") — see the war
   story below for why that wording earns its place. The cap output uses the
   documented universal [`continue:false` / `stopReason` JSON fields](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#json-output)
   so the user sees a capped stop instead of an indistinguishable successful
   Stop. That stops the session; it does **not** protect a publish action. If the
   capped exit says an artifact remains unshipped, enforce that separately at
   the action boundary with PreToolUse.

   Do not copy this counter into an injector whose product is continuing
   availability. If its reminders are too dense, retune the cadence or
   hysteresis from observed usage; if the capped state would be “the condition
   still exists but the hook is silent forever,” the counter has no legitimate
   terminal state and mechanism 3 is the wrong design.

4. **Hysteresis / a cool-down window** (the control-theory answer to
   [alert flapping](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/HysteresisMeaningAndAlerts)):
   after firing, suppress re-evaluation for a window — a stamp file plus
   `[ $(( $(date +%s) - <stamp mtime> )) -lt 900 ] && exit 0` (mtime is
   `stat -L -f %m` on BSD/macOS, `stat -L -c %Y` on GNU — as are the other
   snippets here; **the `-L` is load-bearing when the installer uses symlinks**,
   since without it you read the link's own mtime and
   the stamp never moves when the SSOT is edited — #41). Right for conditions that *oscillate around a threshold*; **wrong** for
   conditions that remediation **resets** — those need 2 or 3.
   ⚠️ **Hysteresis supplies no V — it is a rate limiter, not a termination
   proof.** The loop ends only if the condition subsides on its own, and what
   ends it then is the world, not your hook. So its `# TERMINATION:` line has to
   name that external fact ("by the time the stamp expires, X has been resolved
   by <whom>"). If you can't write that line honestly, what you needed was 2
   or 3. A cool-down controls how often an advisory can speak; it does not turn
   a recurring advisory into the bounded remediation loop mechanism 3 governs.

**Failure direction for the state itself: apply rule 5's question, don't match on
the word.** If the state can't be read or written — unwritable `TMPDIR`, sandbox,
full disk — rule 5's guard-class table decides, and it decides by asking **"if this
state vanished, would remediation still be possible?"** For mechanisms 2 and 3 the
answer is **no** — the receipt is the only record that R happened, and mechanism 3
is deliberately blind to whether R happened at all, so its counter is the only exit
— therefore **allow the stop**. A termination mechanism that cannot read its own
state and blocks anyway *is* the loop, now with no human-visible cause.

⚠️ **Do not route mechanism 3 to rule 5's "inverted sub-case" just because both say
"counter".** That sub-case is for a counter that only *budgets the nagging* on top of
a predicate the user can still satisfy independently — there, going quiet on an
unreadable counter mutes a hook that had another way to clear, so you keep evaluating
the predicate. Mechanism 3 has no such predicate to fall back to. **Measured, and it
is the failure this pairing produces:** paste mechanism 3's snippet into Pattern E's
skeleton (which ships `set -uo pipefail`, per the `-e`-vs-trap bullet), point
`TMPDIR` at an unwritable directory, and it returns exit 2 on five consecutive runs
— `N` never persists past 1, the ceiling is never reached, and #27 already rules out
the harness cap as a backstop once remediation involves tool calls. The failure
direction here is decided entirely by a `set` line the snippet does not carry, so
**put the guard on the step that actually fails — the write — and never on the
read**:

```bash
printf '%s' "$N" > "$CNT" 2>/dev/null || exit 0   # can't persist ⇒ can't terminate
```

The read is already guarded (`cat … 2>/dev/null || echo 0`) and **must stay that
way**: a missing counter file is the normal first run, so `|| exit 0` on the read
silences the hook forever in a perfectly healthy environment. Measured, five
consecutive runs per variant: guarding the write gives `2,2,2,0,0` on a writable
`TMPDIR` and `0,0,0,0,0` on an unwritable one — correct in both; guarding the read
gives `0,0,0,0,0` **in both**, i.e. a guard that never fires at all.

**Prose in the demand text does not substitute for a converging predicate.** A
hook whose message says "if you judge this unnecessary, just finish again" still
costs a full remediation cycle every round, because a model that has been told it
must do X will usually do X. The escape hatch has to be in the **predicate**, not
in the advice.

**The testing requirement, and the easiest thing here to skip:** the self-test
needs an **"after remediation"** case — not just "fires when it should," but
**"stops firing once R is complete."** Without it, non-termination is
*structurally invisible*: every fixture is one isolated point-in-time judgment,
while non-termination is a property of the **sequence**. A suite that only
checks single points has zero coverage of convergence no matter how many cases
it has — which is how a hook can ship with a green self-test and still loop on
its first real encounter. The row pair that *can* see it (receipt absent → fires,
receipt present → quiet, with the setup/teardown a plain `run` row can't express)
is templated in `scripts/test_hook.sh` under "AFTER-REMEDIATION ROWS"; symptom →
cause → fix is pitfall #16.

**Termination proved ≠ it *feels* terminated (2026-07-25 war story).** A Stop
hook with a correct existence-fact V fired three times in one session — each
fire a legitimate *new* push from a *different* completed task, the mechanism
working exactly as designed — and the user's experience was still "why is this
thing stuck in a loop?" (No contradiction with mechanism 2's "nothing R does can
push it back up": **V is per key** — three distinct keys, three separate one-way
decreases. That is also the diagnostic when you can't tell which situation you
are in: if each fire carries a *new* key, the mechanism is right and the density
is the problem; if repeated fires share the *same* key — or the predicate has no
key at all because it compares timestamps — you are in the counter-example above
and the predicate needs replacing.) Three independent remediation cycles back-to-back are
indistinguishable from a loop from the outside. The variant-proof settles the
mechanism; it says nothing about **how many distinct blocking remediations a
session can demand**. If a **blocking Stop hook** produces that density
(compounding artifacts ship several times a day here), consider pairing
mechanism 2 (the existence fact) with mechanism 3 (a session-scoped termination
budget), or accept the optics deliberately and say so in the hook's output —
"blocking demand 2 of at most N" reads as progress, an unadorned repeat reads as
a loop. For a recurring advisory injector, solve density only by
cadence/hysteresis; a lifetime ceiling silently retires the product mid-session.
**(2026-07-26 sequel: the same hook's fires that looked
like this density problem turned out to be 100% false positives — its review
channel was schema-blind in team mode; see the observability form above. Before
accepting density as "legitimate", verify the fires are evidence-based at all.)**

**Termination and worth are separate gates.** V proves a loop ends; the Loop
Contract's budget and capped exit decide whether another cycle is worth paying
for. The hookless review-loop failure that exposed this distinction, including
why scope drift silently minted endless “new” work, is pitfall #36.

### 8. Waiting needs the same proof — notifications are advisory, polling must carry a budget

Rule 7 covers loops a *hook* creates. The same shape recurs with no hook
involved: **an agent polling for an asynchronous result** — a subagent's
report, a background task's completion notice, a CI status. Real session
(2026-07-25): subagent completion notices arrive through a mailbox that can
delay or drop them; three separate agents finished their work while the
notification sat undelivered, and the waiting agent burned a dozen
`sleep 240` + nag cycles over ~40 minutes until the human asked what it was
even doing. Nothing errored; the loop just had no variant.

Rule 7's mechanisms map over — the first two directly; hysteresis has no
analogue (a wait doesn't oscillate), and its slot is taken by a trap specific to
waiting:

1. **Poll the artifact, not the notification.** If what you actually need is a
   result (a file, a git ref, an API state, a row in a DB), wait on *that*, not
   on "did it say it's done." The notification is a hint; the artifact is the
   fact. An existence check terminates the moment the fact lands, regardless of
   whether any message ever arrives.
2. **Every wait carries a budget, chosen when the loop is written.** Max rounds
   × interval (e.g. 3 × 4 min), and a degradation path that exists *before* the
   first sleep: do it yourself, ask the user, or mark it pending and move on to
   other work. "Wait indefinitely and see" is not a degradation path — it's
   the loop.
3. **Delivery protocols are advisory, not mechanism.** "Report back via
   SendMessage when done — silence counts as incomplete" is worth writing, but
   it governs whether the agent *sends*, not whether the mailbox *delivers*.
   Three agents with the protocol in their prompt all went silent in one
   session. Design the wait as if the notification may never arrive — because
   it may not.

Two adjacent traps, both paid for in the same session: **TaskStopping a
"stuck" agent that is actually mid-work** — mailbox delay is not idleness;
one reviewer doing 20 minutes of real corpus testing was killed as "stuck"
minutes before delivering. And **`--dry-run`-style probes of the wait itself**:
before concluding the other side is silent, confirm your own observation
channel works (in that session, System Events window-counting returned a
confident 0 for a dialog that was on screen — a permission failure masquerading
as evidence).

### 9. Fixtures cannot tell you the false-positive rate — replay a real command corpus before you register

Rule 1 ranks *which* error is worse (a false block beats a missed one, because a guard
people must bypass gets bypassed reflexively). Rule 2 makes you test before registering.
Neither of them tells you **how big your false-block surface actually is** — and the test
table cannot, because *you wrote its inputs from the same mental model that produced the
detector*. Its cases carry the shapes you thought of; the shapes you didn't think of are,
by construction, absent. That is not a coverage gap you can close by adding rows.

**Measured, 2026-08-06.** A PreToolUse/Bash guard passed a 26-case table with 5 mutations
run against it, and was registered. Replayed afterwards against **11,903 deduplicated real
commands** harvested from 60 recent session transcripts: 143 produced candidates, the live
hook blocked 46, and hand-checking all 46 found **10 wrong — 21.7% of everything it
blocked** (two borderline calls counted as correct; judged the other way, ~30%). Inside 39
minutes it had blocked 3 real sessions, one of them told to load a skill that cannot exist
— the third defect below, surfacing as remediation guidance that points at nothing. It was
removed the same hour. All three root defects sat in the **parsing** layer: a
line-continuation token read as a separator, a segment scan that counted heredoc bodies and
data arguments as execution, and a path classifier with no type filter.

Two conclusions that story does *not* license. It is **not** "mutation testing doesn't
work": a later audit of that same suite found **5 pieces of the hook's logic that could be
deleted with all 26 rows still green**, and one row its author had annotated as "fixed from
decorative" was still decorative — *"I ran mutation testing" is not "the mutation testing
was right"*, and the replay is what exposed both. And it is **not** "you could not have
known": three of those defects were hand-rolled reimplementations of code this file already
ships (`split_shell_lines`, the command-position walk, `is_git_write`'s handling of `-C`
and its argument). Rule 1's *use the walker verbatim* was the cheaper fix that got skipped;
replay is the backstop, not the first line.

**The method — pay particular attention to step 2:**

1. **Harvest.** Session transcripts live at
   `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, plus any archives registered in
   `~/.claude/history-sources.json`. Commands are `.message.content[]` entries with
   `type == "tool_use"` and `name == "Bash"`, in field `.input.command` — **not** the hook
   event's `.tool_input.command`, which is a different shape. Dedupe, and take enough
   transcripts that your own recent working shapes are in there (that run used 60).
2. **Pre-filter with the shipped detector, sliced out verbatim** — never a hand-written
   equivalent, or you measure the agreement between two of your own guesses. The pre-filter
   exists only for cost (11,903 → 143); step 3 is what decides. If the detector is not a
   liftable block — shell, or split across a sourced library — make it one; a detector you
   cannot run standalone is also one you cannot unit-test.
3. **Feed each candidate to the real hook, with its own real transcript and `session_id`.**
   A guard that reads session state answers differently under a fabricated context. Event
   contract: `references/hook_patterns.md`. Two things will bite — run under a scratch
   `TMPDIR`, or rule 7's receipts and per-session counters write into real sessions *and*
   silence the guard partway through your own measurement; and if the hook has a human
   gate, drive it through Pattern B's forced-decline path rather than answering 143 dialogs.
4. **Hand-check every block — the block list is the false-positive measurement.** The allow
   list answers rule 5's question instead (did it go quiet because nothing was there, or
   because it could not see?), and a replay returning *zero* blocks makes the harness a
   suspect rather than a clean bill — pitfall #11 prescribes this same instrument in the
   under-firing direction.

**What to do with the number.** A false block whose remediation guidance is wrong or
impossible → do not register at all: that shape is the manufacturing process for the
reflexive bypass rule 1 exists to prevent. Otherwise treat the block list as a fix list and
re-replay. Expect the false positives to cluster on **whatever you were doing while you
wrote the guard** — half of that run's landed on hook-development files, because its author
was building hooks that week. And scan the block list specifically for **ops actions**
(edits under the hooks dir, `bash -n` on a hook, the guard's own SSOT): a guard that blocks
its own removal cannot be switched off from inside a session. The nearest recorded case is
#25, where the guard blocked a **read-only** `git config core.hooksPath` query — the same
blind spot one step short of self-lockout. Once a guard HAS locked you out, the escape
routes are in **#3**'s list (edit `settings.json` with the Edit/Write tool, which never
fires a `Bash` matcher; or start a session with a different `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`).

That clustering is a tendency. For a guard whose detector is a **text pattern**, one
family of it is a certainty instead: **documenting the anti-pattern reproduces its own
trigger.** The commit message explaining the guard, the doc example, the note you write
into your own knowledge base — each carries the banned shape verbatim, as data, and each
lands in the corpus. Measured 2026-08-30 on an 852-command replay: of the 4 commands
matching the guard's headline shape, **3 were healthy** — a commit message about the
guard, a doc write embedding the pattern, and the calibration command that deliberately
runs the bad form beside the good one to show the difference. A detector taking the
pattern at face value would have been **75% wrong on its own signature shape**, and every
one of those blocks would have landed on the author mid-sentence, while writing the guard
up. Two exemptions retire the family, and neither is a special case: **data-sink heredoc
bodies** (`references/hook_patterns.md`, under the command-position walker's heredoc
limits — the sink-discriminating stripper), which covers the commit message and the doc
write; and **the correct form present in the same command**, which covers the calibration
— an author who wrote the fix beside the bug is demonstrating it, not committing it. The
second is the same shape as the `pipefail` escape hatch a pipe-fallback guard uses: the
command carries evidence that its author already knows, so stop arguing with them. Its
mechanism is one more literal test, run **before** the detector and short-circuiting it —
for `pipe-fallback-guard` that is the substring set `pipefail`/`PIPESTATUS`/`pipestatus`
(rule 4); for a detector with a canonical fix, it is that fix's distinctive fragment.
Keep it narrow and literal: a *pattern* for the correct form re-opens the whole guessing
problem, whereas a fixed string an author had to type on purpose is hard to hit by
accident, and its failure direction is a miss.

Sizing, so this doesn't read as a research project: one harvest plus one loop, minutes of
wall time.

**Changing a gate that already ships**, above all adding an allow branch, fails in the
other direction: the new branch can let a dangerous command through, and a false-positive
count never shows that. Replay the corpus through the old and new versions, compose the new
branch's trigger into every must-block row, and mutate the branch until those rows go red:
[hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md#changing-a-shipped-gate--prove-a-new-allow-branch-opens-no-hole).

### 10. A guard that blocks legitimate work needs a **consent channel** — and the consent signal must come from a hook that sees the prompt

A guard built to block a failure mode will eventually block a **legitimate,
user-authorized** instance of that same shape. The user authorizes it in the
conversation; the guard cannot know. `home-scan-guard` (blocks enumeration of
personal stash directories) hits this the first time the user says "I authorize
you to scan my Downloads for the disk cleanup."

Capture verbal authorization at the prompt boundary rather than inferring it
from command text. Keep explicit `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse`
registrations; their event-specific handlers may share an engine while keeping
grant and guard logic separate:

```text
UserPromptSubmit granter: reads the user's prompt → matches an explicit
    authorization phrase (consent verb + action noun + target) → writes a
    time-boxed, path-scoped consent file (mtime = grant time)
PreToolUse guard: before blocking, reads the consent file — fresh (≤TTL) and
    covering the target → allow; otherwise block as before
```

**Design constraints that keep the channel from becoming a bypass (all verified
in the 2026-09-19 implementation; the instance is `home-scan-guard.sh` +
`home-scan-consent-granter.sh`, both in `~/scripts/claude-hooks/`):**

- **TTL, always.** A consent file with no expiry is a permanent disarmament.
  Hours, not days.
- **Path-scoped, never blanket-by-default.** Authorizing `~/Downloads` must not
  unlock `~/Pictures`. A wildcard entry is an explicit, separately-phrased act.
- **The highest-blast-radius rule stays hard-blocked.** For home-scan-guard that
  is rule A (whole-home recursion): no phrase unlocks it. Decide per guard which
  rule is consent-eligible; the answer is usually "the narrow one only."
- **The agent must never hand-write the consent file.** The granter's input is
  the user's real typed prompt — that is the only thing an agent cannot forge.
  Hand-writing the file (or synthesizing granter input to match an ambiguous
  verbal OK) defeats the audit trail and turns the guard decorative. Document
  this ban in both hook headers.
- **Ambiguous phrases do not grant.** "我给你授权" alone (no action noun, no
  target) must not unlock anything. Require verb + (action noun OR named
  target). The granter's failure direction is a *missed* grant, never a false
  one — inverse of the guard's.
- **Revocation by phrase** ("撤销 home-scan 授权") and by file deletion.

**Activation evidence:** an invocation of an already registered script reads
its current file; verify its resolved path and dependencies. Register or recover
the granter through its owning installer (in the setup above, `register-hook.sh`),
then apply rule 4's fresh-session event check. Until the granter has been observed
in the session receiving the authorization, use only an owner-documented
user-operated fallback; if none is available, leave the guarded action pending
until a verified grant. Do not infer consent capture from a settings write, or assume that all
registration changes either require a restart or hot reload immediately.

**Calibration is the load-bearing part:** the granter's selftest must prove
both directions — the grant cases pass AND the ambiguous/negation cases do
NOT grant (its failure mode is false grant, the guard's is false block; each
needs its own two-sided probe). The guard's selftest extends to: no consent →
blocks; fresh scoped consent → allows that path only; expired → blocks;
consent never unlocks the hard-blocked rule. A stateful selftest (it creates
the consent file) must back up and restore any real consent file around itself.

## Build order (in sequence)

Before writing or registering another hook, inspect existing engines by mechanism
and host event. Prefer an in-process rule module that shares input parsing and
lazy fact queries. Keep each rule's tool selector, authorization evidence, state
namespace, cadence and failure policy independent; those boundaries do not by
themselves require separate processes. When combining matchers, preserve their
original coverage with internal selectors, including non-Bash tools, and keep
state writers on their original lifecycle events.

Preserve the complete host protocol when combining results: exit 0/1/2, structured
deny, advisory context and error diagnostics. An allow from one rule must not
release another rule's denial. Use separate entries when host/event/runtime
contracts cannot be combined, or when combining independent human waits would
serialize them or truncate their existing budgets. Never apply a short common
timeout to an interactive authorization gate.

Verify both unique matching handlers and spawned interpreters in a representative
native-host task. A dispatcher that launches every old hook as a child reduces
registrations without removing the per-call work. Keep module-specific tests and
observable failure identities; do not merge unrelated judgments into one shared
approval or “already reminded” flag.

1. **Confirm it's a real recurrence**, not hypothetical — else don't build it.
   If the hook will **demand a remediation** rather than just block, write its
   complete Loop Contract (key / axis / T / R / V / budget / two exits) before
   any logic, and put V into the script header as a `# TERMINATION:` line (rule
   7). First check whether the thing you're gating is an *action*, in which case
   a PreToolUse guard on that action removes the loop instead of taming it.
   Can't name a quantity that strictly decreases per `trigger → remediate →
   re-check` cycle? The design is non-terminating — fix the design, not the regex.
   Before adding any repetition counter, name its capped product state. A valid
   loop budget ends as blocked, unshipped, pending, or another explicit terminal
   state. “The advisory is permanently silent although the session continues”
   is not a terminal state; keep recurring advisory delivery lifetime-uncapped
   and prove long-horizon liveness after several fully-due windows instead.
2. Write the rule module in the existing engine's SSOT, or write a separate
   entrypoint only when the contracts above require it. Set executable mode
   only for files invoked directly.
3. **Detection** with shlex token-level matching (rule 1), keyed on a fact the
   world can answer rather than your own rendering or a naming convention (rule 6).
   For repeated Skill-entry bypass, loading and compliant execution are separate
   predicates. Detect the owned operation at its actual write/transport target;
   a loaded marker, temporary directory or repeated request cannot release it.
   Calibrate with the original bypass plus healthy source maintenance, fixtures
   and read-only probes. If only some actions are inspectable, declare that
   scope; installation and unit tests do not prove native interception.
   - **First check whether ShellCheck already decides it — then record the answer,
     because the next author will ask the same question.** It is the de-facto standard
     for shell anti-patterns, so "why didn't you just use shellcheck" is the first
     thing a reviewer asks. Measured 2026-08-15 on **0.11.0** against
     `find . -name x | head -5 || echo "no"` — a fallback that provably can never fire,
     because `||` binds to the pipeline's **last** stage and `head` exits 0 on empty
     input: **default config reports nothing, exit 0**. `--enable=all` surfaces
     **SC2312** (`check-extra-masked-returns`), but it fires on `cmd | jq . || echo bad`
     too, where the last stage genuinely can fail and the fallback is meaningful.
     Reasons that disqualify it as *the gate* — each one generalizes:
     it is **off by default** (so it is not protecting anyone today), it cannot
     distinguish a dead fallback from a live one (blanket firing = the rule-1
     false-block spiral), and its own suggested remedy is "use `|| true` to ignore",
     the opposite of the intent. It also lints **files**, not tool-call events.
     The general shape of the answer: the standard linter is the right thing to
     **check** and usually the wrong thing to **delegate a blocking gate to**, because
     linters are tuned for advisory breadth and a gate needs precision. Your hook's
     contribution is that precision. Shipped example: `pipe-fallback-guard`, whose
     precision lives in a small list of last-stage commands that actually swallow the
     upstream code (`head`/`tail`/`wc`/`cat`/`sort`/…) and which deliberately excludes
     `grep`/`jq`/`awk`/`sed` because those fail for real.
4. **Validate the module and actual entrypoint** with trigger AND healthy-lookalike cases (rule 2); for shell entrypoints, run `bash -n` + `test_hook.sh`. Do not register until green. Include the shapes that carry an unexpanded path (`cd ~/elsewhere && …`, rule 5); if the hook has a human gate, a forced-decline row (Pattern B, "Make the gate testable"); and if it demands remediation, the **after-remediation row pair** — fires without the receipt, quiet with it (template in `scripts/test_hook.sh`; rule 7 — point-in-time fixtures structurally cannot see non-termination).
   - **Provide bidirectional selftests for editing and maintenance.** Syntax and
     registration checks cannot detect a hook that has **degraded into a permanent
     no-op**. A guard that never fires produces output identical to a session with
     nothing to report. Give startup its own owner-declared, bounded offline
     `--liveness` mode. If no such mode is declared, report logic as unverified and
     coverage as unknown/incomplete; do not try legacy `--selftest`, a full battery,
     network calls or a machine audit as a fallback. Keep the coverage boundary straight:
     a bidirectional test exercises *logic*; the exec bit, the symlink and the
     registered path resolving are *deployment* facts the health check's own
     executable/registration scans cover — a green selftest says nothing about wiring,
     and the wiring scans say nothing about logic. Neither substitutes for the other. Two fixtures is the *floor*, not
     the target: a must-block sample **and** a must-pass sample, so it catches "stopped
     firing" and "started false-blocking" alike — one of either kind alone cannot.
     **Size it by mutants killed, not by a fixture count**, and calibrate the way you
     calibrate the suite: break the detector on purpose and confirm `--selftest` exits
     non-zero. A selftest never seen to fail is indistinguishable from `exit 0`.
     Measured on the shipped `compounding-edit-review`: its **first version's two
     fixtures killed only 4 of 14 mutants** — every behavior its own comments declared
     load-bearing had zero coverage, including a mutation that short-circuits the
     anti-loop check while the selftest still printed OK. The revised suite in
     that measurement ran 58 cases.
     The real constraint is not fixture count but **wall-clock at session start**,
     where this is paid on every session: those 58 cases measure **~5.3 s**, against
     **~140 ms** for a two-probe liveness check. When killing the mutants pushes you
     past that budget, **split** rather than shrink — a cheap fixed-size offline
     probe on the declared `--liveness` mode, the full regression battery in
     editing/maintenance checks.
     Shrinking below the mutant-kill line just buys back a selftest that passes
     while the guard is dead.
     **Give the split a trigger, or the full half never runs.** "At build time" is
     not a mechanism — a comment saying *run the full battery after you change this*
     is the same prose-vs-enforcement gap this whole file exists to close, and it
     fails the same way. The shape that closes it, measured on
     `shared-repo-head-drift` (21 cases / 17.8 s cold, collapsing SessionStart's
     health check to a probe of 9 assertions / 2.2 s): keep startup liveness
     separate from maintenance modes such as `--selftest` and `--selftest-full`.
     Have the owning build/commit check run
     the full battery when its validation identity changes; let SessionStart run
     only the bounded probe. A missing full-pass stamp makes full validation due
     at build/commit time, not an instruction to run it during startup. Measured
     why (2026-10-04, a 61-hook fleet): the full battery costs 1m44s cold, and
     concurrent session starts amplify that into 5–10-minute stalls — so the
     build/commit gate should scope selftests to the files staged in that commit,
     or an unrelated broken guard deadlock-blocks the commit that fixes another
     one. **"The hook's code" is the
     registered file plus what it runs and imports.** Most guards are a thin wrapper
     around a classifier in a sibling `.py`, so a signature taken from the wrapper
     alone stays valid through every edit to the logic, and the battery never runs
     after exactly the changes it exists for (#49 — which also gives the dependency
     rule and a one-process implementation).
     Include the resolved interpreter and its version, test harness and relevant
     configuration in that identity, alongside the hook and its dependencies.
     Give each probe and the whole startup scan explicit deadlines; clean up only
     their own descendants on timeout or cancellation. Invoke through the same
     installer-owned runtime as the registered hook, with closed stdin for tests
     that do not consume events. Keep bounded failure diagnostics instead of
     discarding all child output. Record timeout, cancellation, unreadable identity
     or incomplete coverage as unknown under pitfall #53; write pass stamps only
     after the intended test actually completes successfully. Validate this split
     with an unchanged hook, a changed helper and a slow or failed probe: none may
     pull the full battery back into SessionStart. One structural guard for the
     scheduler's own source: if its program bodies live in quoted heredocs inside
     command substitutions, a stray quote in any body comment kills the whole file
     under the macOS stock bash — hoist them out per #57, or the scheduler itself
     joins the guards it polices.
     Choosing the probe's cases is not "the first N": it needs one must-fire and one
     must-quiet, or the two degradation directions are not both covered. Watch for a
     must-quiet case that is secretly vacuous — an advisory-only hook always exits 0,
     so a `run`-style exit-code row proves nothing about false positives there and
     the assertion has to be a `says`-style one (#40, #14).
5. **Replay a real command corpus and hand-check every block** (rule 9) — this measures the
   false-block surface, which the fixture table in step 4 structurally cannot. Slice the
   shipped detector out verbatim to pre-filter; feed each candidate **to** the real hook
   with its own real transcript and `session_id`, under a scratch `TMPDIR`.
6. **Install or recover the entrypoint through its owner** (rule 3). Reuse the
   current entry for a module change; create a symlink only when that installer's
   active-entry contract calls for one. Keep retired aliases unregistered.
7. **Reconcile registrations only when entrypoints or coverage change**, then
   converge profiles and verify effective entries in a fresh native session
   (rule 4). A module-only change does not add a handler.
8. For a Tier-0/irreversible action, add the **human-confirmation release gate** (rule 4).
9. **Persist sources through the repository's normal flow.** When the workflow
   changes, update its affected operator SSOT and CLAUDE.md route. Reuse the
   existing route; do not duplicate implementation facts or add an incident
   bullet to standing instructions.

## Known pitfalls (read before debugging a misfiring hook)

Full catalog with symptom → cause → fix: [references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md).

**The harness is the hidden variable — use `scripts/test_hook.sh`, don't hand-roll
one.** Every hand-rolled failure mode below produces the *same* output as a clean
pass, so it reads as success (2026-07-22, three in one sitting while fixing a Stop
hook's whitelist):

1. **Wrong event shape.** A Stop hook reads `last_assistant_message` /
   `transcript_path`, not `tool_name`/`tool_input`. Feed a PreToolUse-shaped event
   and it finds no text → exits 0 → "no false blocks!"
2. **JSON quoting.** `'{\"a\":1}'` inside single quotes emits a literal
   backslash-quote; `json.loads` throws, the hook's `2>/dev/null || exit 0` swallows
   it, every case "passes".
3. **A test case the rule legitimately exempts.** The baseline string used
   a string the rule *deliberately exempts* (the guard flagged coined nicknames of the
   form `<name> Group`, but exempted the ordinary phrases `in the group` / `group chat`
   — and the baseline row happened to use one of those). The one row meant to prove
   the guard still bites didn't bite, and the whole suite read green.

**And if the hook's product is its message, exit codes cannot test it.** A
blocking hook's contract is mostly its exit code, so `run` rows cover it. But a
hook that exists to *say* something — a PreToolUse explanation of the correct
alternative, a Stop reminder — has a second output channel the codes never see:
break the wording, invert a conditional paragraph, let a heredoc swallow a
section, and the exit code stays exactly 2 while every row passes. Add
`says <label> <event> <pattern> <yes|no>` rows from `scripts/test_hook.sh`,
asserting **both polarities across two fixtures** (present for the input it
targets, absent for the lookalike it skips) — a lone `want=no` passes vacuously
when the hook prints nothing at all, so it only means something beside a
`want=yes` row proving the hook speaks. Match **fixed strings**, not regexes: the
phrases worth asserting often contain brackets, and as a BRE `[skill]` is a
character class matching any text with an s, k, i or l in it. Then **mutate to prove the rows can die**: copy the hook, inject
the exact bug each row claims to catch, and confirm that row goes red. A green
suite carries zero information until you have watched it fail for the right
reason — two real bugs once survived a fully green 24-case suite because every
row looked only at exit codes (pitfall #14).

The common shape: **all-cases-agree is a smell, not a green light.** `test_hook.sh`
catches shapes 1 and 2 above structurally — it asserts an explicit `expected-exit` per `run` row
(not "did it print something") and forces trigger rows alongside healthy-lookalike
ones, so a trigger row that returns 0 fails loudly instead of blending in. It
**cannot** catch #3: whether a row's content accidentally lands in an exemption is a
property of what you wrote, and no harness knows your rule's intent. That one is
caught only by the habit — assert a known-good trigger *first*, and when it doesn't
fire, suspect the row before the hook.

## Reference material

- [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md) — runnable skeletons for every hook type covered here, the shlex command-position walker, and the JSON event contract.
- [references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md) — every real failure mode with symptom → cause → fix.
- [scripts/test_hook.sh](scripts/test_hook.sh) — end-to-end test harness; copy it next to any new hook.
- [scripts/test_hook.group-name-guard.sh](scripts/test_hook.group-name-guard.sh) — a worked harness instance for a real Stop guard: Stop event shapes and an exemption-vs-trigger row set. Takes the hook path as `$1` (`bash test_hook.group-name-guard.sh ~/scripts/claude-hooks/<hook>.sh`); run bare it prints `HOOK not found: …/CHANGE-ME.sh`. **It is not a model for the two things this file asks of a Stop guard** — it carries no `says` rows and no `stop_hook_active` anti-loop row. For those, `scripts/test_hook.sh` is the reference.

## Maintenance — where new content goes

New incident backports land outside this file, in the place that already holds
their kind: a fresh pitfall or failure anatomy →
[references/hook_pitfalls.md](references/hook_pitfalls.md); a reusable
skeleton or pattern → [references/hook_patterns.md](references/hook_patterns.md);
a worked harness instance (a test script) → `scripts/`. This file only takes
**contract-level rules**: content every blocking hook consumes (a new hook
type, a changed exit-code contract, a new rule in the `## Rules that separate
a working guard from a session-poisoning one` series). The loaded-at-trigger
surface stays stable while the knowledge base keeps growing; depth lives one
pointer away.

Why this is written down (2026-08-02): backports have in fact always gone to
references — what grew this file 10k→50k chars in one week was *rules* prose
(rules 5–8 landing inline), which this policy deliberately keeps here. The
policy's job is to make the default explicit for the next session holding a
fresh incident, so future growth stays limited to contract-level rules. A
four-frame design review (cost / SSOT / architecture / evidence,
cross-examined) chose this over a structural split of the eight rules that
existed then. Restart-the-split criteria, for the next time someone proposes one: a
measurement (not a vibe) showing the main file's size degrades rule
compliance, or the whole skill's churn settling (30 consecutive days with no
new rule or backport landing anywhere).
