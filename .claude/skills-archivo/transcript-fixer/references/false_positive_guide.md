# False Positive Prevention Guide

Dictionary-based corrections are powerful but dangerous. Adding the wrong rule silently corrupts every future transcript. The `--add` command runs safety checks automatically, but you must understand the risks.

## What is safe to add

- **ASR-specific gibberish**: "巨升智能" -> "具身智能" (no real word sounds like "巨升智能")
- **Long compound errors**: "语音是别" -> "语音识别" (4+ chars, unlikely to collide)
- **English transliteration errors**: "japanese 3 pro" -> "Gemini 3 Pro"

## What is NEVER safe to add

- **Common Chinese words**: "仿佛", "正面", "犹豫", "传说", "增加", "教育" -- these appear correctly in normal text. Replacing them corrupts transcripts from better ASR models.
- **Words <=2 characters**: Almost any 2-char Chinese string is a valid word or part of one. "线数" inside "产线数据" becomes "产线束据".
- **Both sides are real words**: "仿佛->反复", "犹豫->抑郁" -- both forms are valid Chinese. The "error" is only an error for one specific ASR model.

## Three layers of defense (and why the word list is the weak point)

The guard fires at three points; the first two read `utils/common_words.py`, the third asks the segmenter:

1. **Add time** — `--add` runs `check_correction_safety()` and blocks a rule whose `from_text` is a known common word or a substring-collision source (override with `--force`); a bare number or a single surname + 老师/总 is an error in every mode, with no override, because it names timestamps or everyone with that surname.
2. **Apply time** — Stage 1 defaults to **safe mode**: `_assess_risk()` grades every rule and only low-risk (non-word, high-confidence) ones auto-apply. Common-word / ≤2-char / real-word-fragment rules are written to `*_needs_review.md` instead. So even a bad rule already sitting in the database won't silently corrupt a transcript unless you pass `--apply-all`.
3. **Match time** — `DictionaryProcessor` refuses a match at the position itself, before risk scoring, when the corrected form is already in place (superset check), when a short rule sits inside a longer listed common word, or when the match is a fragment of real words. That last check picks its rule by script: an ASCII match with an ASCII *letter* directly before or after it is inside a longer word (`Cloud` in `iCloud`, `Joe` in `Joey`; digits do not count, so `cloud3` and `fiber5` still correct); a match containing CJK is refused only when every segment of a dictionary-only jieba cut (HMM off, nothing invented) that overlaps it is a multi-character word and at least one of them crosses a match boundary — 新一 in 更新|一下, 下电 in 楼下|电动车, 问题记 in 问题|记录, 同龄 in 同龄人. One single-character segment under the match is what an unknown fragment looks like, so 巨|神智|能, 章|伟大|概 and 叫|新|一下|单 all pass through to risk scoring. Refusals are counted as `Refused at word boundaries` (summary) and `boundary_refused` (JSON), listed in the summary, and never deferred, so a rerun no longer re-defers the same fragments. When the check is wrong: `--apply-all` switches it off for a run and applies every match; a context rule (`--add-context-rule`) skips it for one phrase but is still risk scored, so in safe mode that match is deferred to the review queue, where it is accepted like any other row; `--apply-domain` keeps the check. The cut itself depends on jieba's bundled dictionary (`requirements.txt` pins only a floor), so the examples here hold for the dictionary shipped with jieba 0.42.1. **Without jieba the CJK half of this check does not run at all** — every CJK match goes straight to risk scoring. That is fail-open, so it is announced rather than assumed: a one-time stderr warning, a `Refused at word boundaries: CHECK OFF` line in the summary instead of a count, and `boundary_check_active: false` in the JSON. Read that flag before trusting `boundary_refused`; on its own, `0` cannot distinguish "nothing straddled" from "nothing was examined". Blind spots, both directions: a real mishearing whose neighbours complete whole words on both sides is refused; a fragment whose neighbours are single-character or out-of-vocabulary words (的是 in 看它的是什么, 书妙 in 飞书妙记) is not — safe mode still defers it as before, so "a rerun no longer re-defers the same fragments" holds only for words jieba knows.

The catch: the add-time and apply-time layers are only as good as the word list. **A real word missing from `common_words.py` is invisible to both of those checks** — that is exactly how `多深`, `小龙虾`, and `早生` slipped in and then got applied (fixed 2026-06; they are in the list now). So when you find a false positive whose `from_text` is a genuine word, add it to `common_words.py` — not just to the per-rule disable list. That fixes the whole class, not the one instance.

## The corpus answers what the word list cannot (project-domain rules)

The word-list checks answer "is this a real word **in Chinese**". A project-domain rule needs a different question answered: "when this word appears in **this project's** transcripts, is it ever the real meaning?" That is empirical — measure it before deciding the rule's shape:

```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --probe "候选词" --corpus /path/to/transcripts/
# or inline during the add:
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --add "候选词" "正确词" --domain myproject --check-corpus --corpus /path/to/transcripts/
```

Read the sampled context windows, then decide by **in-corpus real-meaning frequency**:

| In-corpus reality | Rule shape |
|---|---|
| 0 occurrences (the term never appears at all) | bare rule is zero-risk, but compounds nothing until the term actually recurs — and if you expected hits, re-check the corpus path (a probe cannot tell "absent" from "never searched") |
| Every sampled occurrence is the ASR error | bare rule is likely safe — **even if the FROM side is a "real word"** (a colleague's name ASR keeps garbling: every in-corpus occurrence of the garbled form IS them). Mind the coverage line: samples are capped, so occurrences in unsampled files were never inspected |
| Mixed (real meanings present) | anchored rule (`--add "搭配短语" "修正短语"`) or no rule — record the trap in the domain context file |
| Real usage dominates | do not add; context-file trap only |

Both directions of intuition fail without the measurement: "obviously an error form" turns out to carry real meanings all over one corpus, and "obviously a real word" turns out to be the mishearing in 100% of another corpus's occurrences. The probe makes the shape decision a 30-second lookup instead of a guess.

## When in doubt, use a context rule instead

Context rules use regex patterns that match only in specific surroundings, avoiding false positives:
```bash
# Instead of: --add "线数" "线束"
# Use a context rule in the database:
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "INSERT INTO context_rules (pattern, replacement, description, priority) VALUES ('(?<!产)线数(?!据)', '线束', 'ASR: 线数->线束 (not inside 产线数据)', 10);"
```

## Auditing the dictionary

Run `--audit` periodically to scan all rules for false positive risks:
```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --audit
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --audit --domain manufacturing
```

## The 4+ char real-word blind spot (important)

The risk classifier and the common-word list only catch short / listed words. A rule whose `from_text` is a **4+ character string that is itself valid Chinese** (`济南大学`→`暨南大学`, `关税证明`→`完税证明`, `老公说的`→`老郭说的`) is classified `low` and **auto-applies even in safe mode** — silently corrupting clean transcripts that legitimately contain that phrase. The common-word list cannot scale to this: Chinese has hundreds of thousands of valid multi-char phrases.

`--audit` flags these with a `valid_phrase` warning, using a jieba heuristic (`is_likely_valid_phrase`): it reports rules whose `from_text` decomposes entirely into known dictionary words. **This is advisory and deliberately low-precision** — it also flags many legitimate ASR-garble rules (e.g. `一视同然`→`一视同仁`, where `from_text` happens to split into known tokens). When reviewing `valid_phrase` hits, the question to ask is *"is `from_text` itself a fluent, real phrase someone would actually say?"* — if yes, it's a dangerous rule (disable it); if it's garble that merely tokenizes cleanly, keep it. This is why the heuristic never gates auto-application: a false flag there would silently cut recall. Genuinely closing this class needs language-model-grade judgment.

**Disabling audit hits is a human decision — never automate it.** When you act on `valid_phrase` (or any audit) results, review each candidate by hand; do NOT bulk-disable everything flagged. Roughly half a batch can be context-specific GOOD rules the audit mislabels, because neither jieba nor an LLM reviewer knows the dictionary owner's context — which products/terms they say often. `GDP 5.5→GPT 5.5` reads as "GDP is a common word" to any general reviewer, yet is a correct `GPT 5.5` ASR fix for an AI-heavy user; `长城任务→长程任务` (same pronunciation) is a correct "long-horizon task" fix. Even an LLM review pass (more accurate than jieba) mislabeled ~half a batch this way in practice. So: the audit surfaces candidates, the **owner** decides, and you back up the DB (`cp corrections.db corrections.db.bak-…`) before any disable so it is reversible.

## Forcing a risky addition

If you understand the risks and still want to add a flagged rule:
```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --add "仿佛" "反复" --domain general --force
```

## Re-adding a disabled rule

`--report-false-positive FROM TO` soft-deletes a rule (`is_active=0`) rather than removing it — the row stays so the audit trail is preserved and the exact `(from_text, domain)` can't be silently re-inserted. If you later want that `from_text` back — most often because the disable was really about a **wrong target** (the rule was disabled because it pointed at the wrong correction, and the right fix is a different target) — re-running `--add` does **not** silently resurrect it:

```bash
# Without --force: reports the disable and refuses, so a deliberate
# false-positive disable is never un-done by accident.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --add "小茗" "小明" --domain demo
# -> Correction '小茗' -> '小名' exists in domain 'demo' but is DISABLED
#    ([FALSE POSITIVE reported by <user>]), added 2026-01-01 ...
#    To reactivate it with target '小明', re-run with --force.

# With --force: reactivates (is_active=1) AND updates the target,
# writing a reactivate_correction audit entry.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --add "小茗" "小明" --domain demo --force
```

Reactivating restores the rule to `--apply-all` (and, per its risk grade, safe-mode) behavior, so re-verify it the same way you would a fresh `--add`.
