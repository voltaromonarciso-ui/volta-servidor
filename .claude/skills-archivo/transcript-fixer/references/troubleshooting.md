## API Authentication Errors

### API Key Not Configured

**Symptom**:
```
❌ API key not configured. Please add it to the config file:
   ~/.transcript-fixer/config.json
   { "api": { "api_key": "your-key" } }
   Or set GLM_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.
```

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Make sure the config directory exists
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --init

# 2. Edit the config file and set api.api_key
# ~/.transcript-fixer/config.json
```

**Quick override** (not recommended for long-term use):
```bash
export GLM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

See `glm_api_setup.md` for detailed API key management.

### Invalid API Key

**Symptom**: API calls fail with 401/403 errors

**Solutions**:
1. Verify key is correct (copy from https://open.bigmodel.cn/)
2. Check for extra spaces or quotes in the config file
3. Confirm the config uses `api.api_key`, not a top-level key
4. Regenerate key if compromised
5. Verify API quota hasn't been exceeded

## Learning System Issues

### No Suggestions Generated

**Symptom**: Running `--review-learned` shows no suggestions after multiple corrections.

**Requirements**:
- Repeated Stage 2 / AI changes saved in `correction_history` + `correction_changes`
- Minimum frequency is 3, but the current confidence formula usually needs more repeated occurrences before crossing the 0.8 review threshold
- Learning confidence threshold ≥0.8 (default)

**Diagnostic steps**:

```bash
# Check successful correction history count
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM correction_history WHERE success = 1;"

# If 0, no corrections have been run yet
# If the repeated AI pattern count is still low, run more similar corrections

# Check repeated AI patterns visible to --review-learned
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "
SELECT c.from_text, c.to_text, h.domain, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM correction_changes c
JOIN correction_history h ON h.id = c.history_id
WHERE c.rule_type = 'ai' AND h.success = 1
GROUP BY c.from_text, c.to_text, h.domain
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
"

# Check pending review file produced by --review-learned
cat ~/.transcript-fixer/learned/pending_review.json

# Check system configuration
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "SELECT key, value FROM system_config WHERE key LIKE 'learning%';"
```

**Solutions**:
1. Run more similar correction sessions until repeated AI patterns cross the review threshold
2. Ensure patterns repeat (same error → same correction)
3. Verify database permissions (should be readable/writable)
4. Check `correction_history` and `correction_changes` have successful AI entries

## Database Issues

### Database Not Found

**Symptom**:
```
⚠️  Database not found: ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db
```

**Solution**:
```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --init
```

This creates the database with the complete schema.

### Database Locked

**Symptom**:
```
Error: database is locked
```

**Causes**:
- Another process is accessing the database
- Unfinished transaction from crashed process
- File permissions issue

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Check for processes using the database
lsof ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db

# If processes found, kill them or wait for completion

# If database is corrupted, backup and recreate
cp ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections_backup.db
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "VACUUM;"
```

### Corrupted Database

**Symptom**: SQLite errors, integrity check failures

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Check integrity
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# If corrupted, attempt recovery
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db ".recover" | sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections_new.db

# Replace database with recovered version
mv ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections_corrupted.db
mv ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections_new.db ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db
```

### Missing Tables

**Symptom**:
```
❌ Database missing tables: ['corrections', ...]
```

**Solution**: Reinitialize schema (safe, uses IF NOT EXISTS):

```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --init
```

Or delete database and reinitialize:

```bash
# Backup first
cp ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db ~/corrections_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Reinitialize
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --init
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Stage 1 reports "Applied: 0" (usually correct, not a bug)

Safe mode is the default, so Stage 1 only auto-applies **low-risk** (non-word, high-confidence) corrections. On a clean transcript — or one from a strong ASR engine — there may be no low-risk dictionary hits, so `Applied: 0` is expected. Any medium/high-risk candidates are written to `*_needs_review.md` for you to confirm. To apply every risk level (the pre-safe-mode behavior), pass `--apply-all`.

### 1. Native route versus API stages

**Problem**: Treating the CLI stage number as the skill's recommended route.

**Solution**: Inside Claude/Codex, run explicit Stage 1 and then Native AI
Correction. In agent-less API automation, Stage 2 and Stage 3 both run Stage 1
internally; Stage 3 additionally creates the diff report.

```bash
# Agent session (recommended)
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --input file.md --stage 1
# Then perform Native AI Correction with this skill loaded.

# Agent-less API route
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --input file.md --stage 2
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --input file.md --stage 3  # adds diff report
```

### 2. Overwriting Imports

**Problem**: Using `--import` without `--merge` overwrites existing corrections.

**Solution**: Always use `--merge` flag:

```bash
# Wrong: Overwrites existing
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --import team.json  # ❌

# Correct: Merges with existing
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --import team.json --merge  # ✅
```

### 3. Ignoring Learned Suggestions

**Problem**: Not reviewing learned patterns, missing free optimizations.

**Impact**: Patterns detected by AI remain expensive (Stage 2) instead of cheap (Stage 1).

**Solution**: Review suggestions every 3-5 runs:

```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --review-learned
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --approve "错误" "正确"
```

### 4. Testing on Large Files

**Problem**: Testing dictionary changes on large files wastes API quota.

**Solution**: Start with `--stage 1` on small files (100-500 lines):

```bash
# Test dictionary changes first
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --input small_sample.md --stage 1

# Review output, adjust corrections
# Then run full pipeline
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --input large_file.md --stage 3
```

### 5. Manual Database Edits Without Validation

**Problem**: Direct SQL edits might violate schema constraints.

**Solution**: Always validate after manual changes:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db
# ... make changes ...
.quit

# Validate
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --validate
```

### 6. Committing .db Files to Git

**Problem**: Binary database files in Git cause merge conflicts and bloat repository.

**Solution**: Use JSON exports for version control:

```bash
# .gitignore
*.db
*.db-journal
*.bak

# Export for version control instead
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --export corrections_$(date +%Y%m%d).json
git add corrections_*.json
```

### 7. Leftover `_stage1.md` / `_dryrun.md` Files

**Problem**: After correction you end up with multiple intermediate files (`file_stage1.md`, `file_dryrun.md`, `file_changes.md`, `file_needs_review.md`) in the working directory.

**Preferred solution**: Re-run `--stage 1` on the original `file.md` — plain, **without `--apply-all`** (an explicit `--apply-all` always runs corrections and never takes the promote path, so it won't finalize). If `file_stage1.md` is newer than `file.md`, transcript-fixer automatically promotes it to `file.md` and removes disposable sidecars. It preserves `file_changes.md` and `file_needs_review.md` until you explicitly close their review decisions. It skips promotion if `file.md` has been edited more recently, so it never overwrites your manual changes. This is the recommended finalize path.

```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --input file.md --stage 1
```

**Manual fallback**: In the native AI-correction workflow, edit the original `file.md` directly, archive it, then delete only the disposable sidecars with a Python one-liner (avoids macOS `mv` alias hazards):

```bash
uv run python -c "
from pathlib import Path
stem = 'file'
for suffix in ['_stage1.md','_dryrun.md','_uncertain.md','_stage2.md','_对比.html']:
    p = Path(f'{stem}{suffix}')
    p.exists() and p.unlink()
"
```

The manual cleanup also leaves `_changes.md` and `_needs_review.md` untouched. Close those with the command built for it rather than by hand:

```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --close-sidecars --input file.md --dry-run   # verdict only
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --close-sidecars --input file.md             # removes on `closed`
```

It re-reads every entry of both reports against the transcript (ledger line masked) and the review queue for that exact file: `closed` (exit 0) removes the evidence and stale run outputs; `open` (exit 1) names each entry that still reads as the original without a verdict and each pending queue id; `blocked` (exit 2) means a `_stage1.md` newer than the file is waiting for the plain Stage 1 rerun above, or a report carries entries the tool cannot read (`report_unparsed`) — inspect that file by hand instead of deleting it. `--decide-raw kept_original|skipped --by <who> --note <why>` records a verdict through the queue for entries that have no row, so nothing is deleted without an audit trail. A `_stage2.md`/`_dryrun.md` newer than the transcript is retained and named; add `--discard-unpromoted` to drop it.

**Why not a bare `mv`**: On macOS, `mv` is commonly aliased to `mv -i`. A bare `mv file_stage1.md file.md && echo done` can skip the overwrite (still exit 0) when the target already exists, leaving the uncorrected file in place. Use the Python one-liner above, or `/bin/mv -f`, if you must use the shell:

```bash
/bin/mv -f file_stage1.md file.md          # /bin/mv ignores the alias; -f forces overwrite
grep -c '<the-WRONG-form-you-replaced>' file.md   # must print 0
```

Verify the claim you need: absence of the old form. Presence of the corrected
term is not evidence that this occurrence changed, because the correct term may
already appear elsewhere in the transcript. A nonzero old-form count means the
promotion or replacement is incomplete.

## Validation Commands

### Quick Health Check

```bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --validate
```

### Detailed Diagnostics

```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Check table counts
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "
SELECT 'corrections' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM corrections
UNION ALL
SELECT 'context_rules', COUNT(*) FROM context_rules
UNION ALL
SELECT 'learned_suggestions', COUNT(*) FROM learned_suggestions
UNION ALL
SELECT 'correction_history', COUNT(*) FROM correction_history;
"

# Check configuration
sqlite3 ~/.transcript-fixer/corrections.db "SELECT * FROM system_config;"
```

## Getting Help

If issues persist:

1. Run `--validate` to collect diagnostic information
2. Check `correction_history` and `audit_log` tables for errors
3. Review `references/file_formats.md` for schema details
4. Check `references/architecture.md` for component details
5. Verify Python and uv versions are up to date

For database corruption, automatic backups are created before migrations. Check for `.bak` files in `~/.transcript-fixer/`.
