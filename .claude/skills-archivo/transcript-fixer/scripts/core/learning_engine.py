Learning Engine - Pattern Detection from Correction History

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: Analyze history and suggest new corrections

Features:
- Analyze correction history for patterns
- Detect frequently occurring corrections
- Calculate confidence scores
- Generate suggestions for user review
- Track rejected suggestions to avoid re-suggesting

CRITICAL FIX (P1-1): Thread-safe file operations with file locking
- Prevents race conditions in concurrent access
