"""
Review Queue - persistent store for uncertain corrections awaiting a human verdict.

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: track review items (uncertain ASR corrections) and execute
their proposed action packs once a human decides.

Why this exists: the pipeline has three places where "needs a human" items were
produced but never persisted anywhere durable —
  1. native AI-pass uncertain items (previously only listed in chat, evaporated)
  2. Stage 1 safe-mode deferrals (previously only a *_needs_review.md sidecar,
     which callers running in temp dirs silently discarded)
  3. learned suggestions (CLI-only review entry, effectively unused)
This module gives all three one queue with an append-audited decision lifecycle,
so confirmations compound into the dictionary instead of being lost.

Design (borrowed from annotation-tool practice — Prodigy/Argilla):
  * every item carries a PRE-FILLED suggestion + evidence, so agreeing is one action
  * decisions are atomic: validate ALL proposed actions first, then apply
    (an item whose anchor text has drifted fails closed — "re-anchor needed" —
    rather than editing the wrong text; a wrong auto-edit is worse than a missed one)
  * the queue is CLI-first: the web dashboard shells out to the CLI for every
    write, so agent and human are equal writers and the DB stays the SSOT

        The accept path fails closed once the anchored occurrence cannot be
        located, because "not where it was" alone cannot tell a hand-applied
        fix from a drifted file. This is the one shape it CAN tell apart: the
        context recorded at enqueue time reappears in the file with `new` in
        the exact slot `old` occupied and the recorded neighbours on both
        sides of that slot intact. The whole file is searched, not a window
        around the line hint: frontmatter growth or a deleted paragraph
        shifts every later line, and with the original gone a hint that
        drifted past the resolve window would otherwise strand a row
        whose fix is in place. The occurrence count of `old` is deliberately
        not a precondition — a suggestion that contains the original
        (阿里→阿里云) never lets `old` disappear.

        Neighbour width is tried from 8 characters down to 2, so a second
        correction on the same line that leaves at least two recorded
        characters between itself and this slot does not defeat the check; an
        edit touching the slot does (fail closed). A one-sided neighbourhood
        (anchor at a snippet edge) must be at least 3 characters to stand in
        for the missing side, and a snippet that is the bare token carries no
        neighbours to verify — fail closed. No snippet: fail closed.

        Verdicts, each fail-closed except the first:
          applied     — the neighbourhood reads with `new` and nothing below
                        contradicts it; `hit_lines` says where.
          survivor    — `old` still occurs within ±window lines of the hint
                        outside any occurrence of `new`: the anchored
                        utterance, or a look-alike right next to it, is still
                        garbled; the normal locate-and-edit ladder decides.
          other_form  — the recorded neighbourhood occurs somewhere with a
                        third form in the slot: anywhere in the file at the
                        width that matched, or within ±window lines of the
                        hint at any width down to 2 (a hand edit that changed
                        the anchored line to something else, with an
                        adjacent co-edit, is caught here as long as two
                        recorded characters survive on each side of the
                        slot). Which line the row meant is ambiguous; the
                        row needs a human exit, not a recorded `accepted`.
          absent      — the neighbourhood does not read with `new` anywhere.

        Boundaries this cannot see, by construction: the anchored utterance
        deleted outright (or rewritten past both neighbours) while an
        identical neighbourhood elsewhere already reads with `new` — that is
        indistinguishable from drift and is `applied`; nothing is written
        either way, `reopen` re-pends the row, and a garble that is still in
        the file is re-deferred by the next Stage 1 run. `content` is the
        ledger-masked text, so an `asr_note` citation of the new form can
        never satisfy this.

    revert or a re-anchor — editing one rewrites the audit trail (2026-09-20
    #2241: a reopen revert turned 「旧词→新词」 into 「旧词→旧词」 because the new
    form survived only in the ledger line).

    Only the `asr_note:` KEY is a ledger. An earlier version flagged the whole
    frontmatter block, which made every other frontmatter key un-revertible
    while the accept path could still edit it (`title: 旧词 → 新词` accepted
    fine, then reopen refused with "survives only in the asr_note ledger" — a
    verdict that pointed the operator at the wrong place entirely). The accept
    path's own notion of the ledger is `dictionary_processor._mask_ledger_spans`,
    and it masks exactly `asr_note:` values; the two sides now agree. Writing
    into a frontmatter key that is not a ledger and not being able to take it
    back is the defect, and widening the revert refusal would only have widened
    the asymmetry."""

    The ledger is excluded on both sides of the count: a new form that
    survives ONLY in an asr_note line is a ledger citation, not an un-reverted
    edit — reverting it would corrupt the audit trail (#2241, 2026-09-20).

    The count has to be exact in BOTH dimensions. Counting lines alone let a
    line carrying the replacement text twice through as "reverted": the accept
    had landed on the second occurrence, `replace(..., 1)` undid the FIRST one,
    and the caller was told the edit was undone while the transcript still
    carried it — plus one pre-existing occurrence silently rewritten to the old
    form. origin/main refused this shape outright ("appears 3 times (need
    exactly 1)"); the line-level rewrite lost that, so the in-line count is
