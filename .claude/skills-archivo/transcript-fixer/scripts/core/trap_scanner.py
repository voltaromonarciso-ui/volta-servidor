"""
Trap Scanner — locate a domain context file's documented traps in a transcript.

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY: parse `**误识 → 正确**` trap entries out of a
per-domain context markdown (see references/domain_context_guide.md), scan a
transcript for every documented FROM-variant, and report each hit with its
line number and a surrounding context window.

Why this exists: the native-pass "trap-scan" step used to be a hand-rolled
grep loop — one grep per trap word, per transcript. On a domain context file
carrying ~30 traps that is 30+ manual greps per file, and the list is exactly
the kind of thing a tired operator truncates. The context file is already the
SSOT for "which homophones this domain produces"; scanning should consume it
mechanically so the human/agent spends judgment only on the hits, never on
remembering what to grep.

Entry shapes parsed (all observed in production context files):
  - **减 → 剪** — 判据说明…                     (single variant)
  - **减 ≈ 剪** — 判据说明…                     (legacy mapping alias; left is
                                                 still observed ASR text)
  - **甲吸引/甲新鲜/甲新的 → 甲锡颖** — …         (multi-variant, "/" separated)
  - **`CC 思维链` → 目标术语** — …                (quoted exact phrase; internal
                                                 whitespace is literal)
  - **报 → 爆（anchored）** — …                  (TO side carries a parenthesized
                                                 annotation — stripped)
  - **撕 → "丝"** — …                            (TO side quoted — stripped)
  - **Brooklyn = 真实实体，勿修** — …            (confirmed-correct record:
                                                 '=' + a keep-word; scanned
                                                 too, so a second pass stops
                                                 re-investigating them)

Bold spans without → are ignored (they are emphasis, not traps). The scanner
never edits anything — it reports, the native pass adjudicates per the trap's
documented cue.
