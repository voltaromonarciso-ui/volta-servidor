"""The skill's copy-me audio examples must survive being copied.

Why this file exists: the `audio:` frontmatter example has shipped broken twice.
Both times it grew a trailing `# …` annotation explaining what to do with the
line — which is helpful to read and fatal to copy, because the dashboard's
parser takes everything after the first colon and does not strip comments. The
result is a path that does not exist, and the card then renders with no play
button *and no error*, which reads exactly like "this transcript has no audio."

Prose cannot defend against this: the warning against trailing comments was
already sitting nine lines below the broken example both times. A test can.

This file mirrors production rather than importing it (`server.py` pulls in the
web stack, which the test suite does not require). Mirroring is only safe while
the two agree, so the drift guard below is scoped to production's actual
function body — a whole-file substring check would keep passing if production
*added* comment-stripping, which is precisely the change that would invert the
rule encoded here and turn this test into one that fails healthy examples.
