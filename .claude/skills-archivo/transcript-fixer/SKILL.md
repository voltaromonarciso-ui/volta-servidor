description: >-
  Corrects ASR/STT transcription errors — homophones, garbled terms, person-name errors, mixed
  Chinese/English — with dictionary rules plus Claude's built-in AI, no external API key required.
  Use to clean meeting notes, lecture transcripts, interviews or speech-recognition text, even when
  the user only says "fix this transcript". Not for structuring a clean transcript into minutes (use
  meeting-minutes-taker).

# Transcript Fixer

Use a two-phase loop:

1. Stage 1 applies deterministic, already-known corrections.
2. Native AI Correction reads the complete transcript, fixes one-off errors, verifies uncertain entities, and compounds reusable fixes.

**Native AI Correction is the default. Stage 1 alone is incomplete.** Stage 3 API exists only for automation that has no Claude/Codex agent available.

## Operating contract

- Finish Stage 1 → Native AI Correction → compound confirmed recurring fixes. Do not report a transcript clean after Stage 1 alone.
- Skip Native AI only when the human explicitly limits this run to the dictionary pass or a dated artifact proves Native AI already ran on this exact transcript.
- In Claude Code or Codex, do not run Stage 3. Use Stage 1 plus the native workflow.
- Never rewrite speech for fluency. A correction must explain a plausible ASR error and preserve who said what.
- Never infer or reassign speaker identities. Preserve speaker-label lines; human-confirmed labels and user verdicts are authoritative.
- When comparing two transcripts of the same session (a 1.3x-sped Feishu 妙记 vs a full-speed one, DJI vs 录音豆, two devices, or any duplicate/overlapping capture), do NOT let an alignment script's output stand in for reading. Script diffs (`difflib`, normalize-and-compare, per-turn speaker-label counts) are locators for *candidate* divergent segments only — their similarity ratios, "identical turn counts", and "speaker-divergence counts" are never the conclusion. Read both transcripts turn by turn yourself and decide from that. Real case 2026-09-18: a per-line regex that missed continuation lines reported "150 speaker divergences, all empty" then flipped to "1" once multi-line bodies were parsed — the whole numeric range was parser noise, and a canonical swap was nearly made on it. Corroboration that is genuinely independent requires a different recognizer over the source audio (rung 7), not a re-segmentation of the same recognition.
- Parsing a Feishu 妙记 `.txt` (or any `speaker HH:MM:SS.mmm` transcript): the spoken text lives on the lines AFTER the speaker-label line, up to the next label — not on the label line itself. A single-line regex (`group(3)` of the label) reads every multi-line turn's body as empty. Counting speakers or turns: use UTF-8-safe tooling (Python), never `sort | uniq -c` or `awk '{print $1}'` — both silently collapse distinct CJK speaker labels into one (2026-08-29 `sort|uniq` folded 5 speakers' 106 turns into "说话人A 106"; 2026-09-18 `awk $1` reported "说话人A 373" for a file whose real distribution was 说话人A17/说话人B287/说话人C60/说话人D9).
- Before correcting any person name, directly read both the configured global people roster and the owning project's explicit identity roster or alias ledger. Stage 1 auto-loads only global `ASR 变体` entries; it does not load project rosters or expose suppressed, disabled, and unlisted entries. If an expected source is missing or the sources conflict, leave the name unchanged and enqueue or ask once. Never use occurrence frequency as identity evidence. Read [references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md](references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md) before settling the name.
- Resolve doubts from available evidence before escalating. Audio download is one evidence channel, not a prerequisite for Native correction. When it is unavailable, follow [evidence selection and escalation](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md#evidence-selection-and-escalation); do not require the user to change download permissions or treat every pending row as a question only they can answer.
- Leave genuinely unresolved text unchanged and enqueue it. A visible garble is safer than a fluent wrong guess; a pending row records uncertainty, not an automatic human handoff.
- Treat an unfamiliar token as unknown, not as an error. Exhaust the local evidence ladder first. For a load-bearing token that remains unresolved, use the clip-level cross-recognizer rung only when source audio and a permitted second engine are already available; otherwise continue with the available evidence under the escalation policy above. Agreement from a genuinely different recognizer family strongly corroborates the sound, but never chooses between homophonic spellings or overrides the person-name gate. Read native workflow step 4, rung 7 before using it. **A backlog of exhausted pendings is the batch form of this rung**: when a native pass leaves a queue of locally-unresolvable rows, do not hand the queue to the user wholesale — check it with `verify_queue_audio.py` (one transcript, one source audio, one second engine, two clip windows per row). The script can attach acoustic evidence but never records a verdict; identical clips and readings that do not support the disputed word boundary remain pending for adjudication. The operator matrix and timestamp-mapping pitfalls live in [advanced_correction_evidence.md](references/advanced_correction_evidence.md) § Batch pending adjudication.
- Treat a single-line `asr_note` value as correction provenance: it intentionally cites old forms and is excluded from matching. Multi-line YAML ledger values are not masked; keywords, titles, other ASR-derived metadata, and body text remain in correction scope.
- Read [references/native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md) in full before performing a native pass. Read the task-specific references named below before their corresponding action.

## Run context

Run every entrypoint through `uv run`; entrypoints that need third-party Python packages declare them with PEP 723, while stdlib/internal-only utilities may omit the metadata block. Execute commands from the skill directory printed when this skill was invoked, or prefix every script path with that directory. Do not rely on `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR`; it is not available in every harness.

If the bundle location is genuinely unknown, use the installation-resolution procedure in [references/installation_setup.md](references/installation_setup.md). Do not select the first result from a broad `find`: caches, backups, and old versions can coexist.

## Quick start

~~~bash
# Initialize once
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --init

# Stage 1 for one project domain. --apply-domain trusts that explicitly
# selected, human-curated project domain at every risk level.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input meeting.md --stage 1 \
  --domain myproject --apply-domain --json

# Several sibling domains may be loaded as one union.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input meeting.md --stage 1 \
  --domain myproject,myproject-alt --apply-domain --json

# Preview without writing the Stage 1 output.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input meeting.md --stage 1 --domain myproject --dry-run

# Scan all documented context traps after the native read-through.
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --scan-traps \
  --context-file ~/.transcript-fixer/contexts/myproject.md \
  --input meeting.md
~~~

Safe mode is the Stage 1 default: low-risk rules apply; medium/high-risk matches defer to `*_needs_review.md` and the persistent review queue. `Applied: 0` is a valid result, not proof that the transcript is clean.

The Stage 1 JSON contract is:

~~~json
{
  "applied": 0,
  "deferred": 0,
  "output_path": null,
  "needs_review_path": null,
  "input_unchanged": true,
  "review_enqueued": 0,
  "stage1_only_incomplete": true,
  "stage2_total_chunks": 0,
  "stage2_failed_chunks": 0,
  "stage2_degraded": false,
  "boundary_refused": 0
}
~~~

Read every field in the result. `boundary_refused` counts dictionary matches the word-boundary check refused this run — neither applied nor deferred, so a caller comparing runs can see why a deferral disappeared; `--apply-all` switches that check off. `stage1_only_incomplete` is additive to the original caller contract and must remain true for a Stage 1 script run; only the caller can close it by running Native AI, or by explicitly choosing the agent-less Stage 2/3 route. The `stage2_*` telemetry fields are always present: Stage 1 reports `0`, `0`, and `false`; Stage 2/3 replace them with the actual API outcome. Do not infer no-op or success from whether a sidecar exists.

For a native end-to-end example, read [references/example_session_dji_minutes.md](references/example_session_dji_minutes.md).

## Choose the route

| Route | Use when | Required reading |
|---|---|---|
| Fast native | Short/plain transcript, known speakers, low stakes | This file + [native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md) |
| Full native | Domain-heavy, unfamiliar entities, 3+ speakers, long or decision-bearing transcript | [native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md), plus queue and evidence references below |
| Caller integration | Another skill or ingest pipeline invokes Stage 1 | `Cross-skill caller contract` below |
| Review queue/dashboard | Any item is uncertain or needs audio | [review_queue_dashboard.md](references/review_queue_dashboard.md) |
| Agent-less API | CI/batch automation with no agent available | [glm_api_setup.md](references/glm_api_setup.md) and [workflow_guide.md](references/workflow_guide.md) |
| Multi-file batch | Several related transcripts; especially 10+ files | [advanced_correction_evidence.md](references/advanced_correction_evidence.md) |

Use vocabulary and stakes as the primary tier signals; use length only as a tiebreaker. A five-minute medical interview can require the full tier, while a long plain two-person memo can use the fast tier.

## Native correction checklist

1. **Give the file its final name before Stage 1.** Queue anchors store absolute paths. Use a human-readable project filename before any deferral can enqueue. When the input arrives as inline text with no file yet — a slash-command argument, a pasted block — write it to a file before anything else; `--input` and the queue anchors both need a path, and a scratch location is fine when nothing downstream will archive it. No `--domain` given and none obvious from context? Omitting the flag already defaults to searching every domain (`--domain`'s own default), so don't block on picking one — run Stage 1 bare and let safe mode gate what auto-applies. If a specific candidate still needs resolving, one step of the ladder is cheap enough to keep even at fast tier though the rest of it isn't: native_ai_full_workflow.md step 4's rung 1, a single cross-domain lookup — `--lookup "<term>"` prints every existing claim on the term (dictionary rules active or disabled, as FROM or TO; context rules; roster variants; queue rows) — not the full verification ladder the tier table tells you to skip, just that one query.
2. **Recover the raw baseline before reading a pre-corrected transcript.** If an ingest pipeline or previous API pass already touched the text, diff against the raw source first. Judge upstream edits as edits, not as ground truth.
3. **Load project priors and read the complete transcript.** Read `~/.transcript-fixer/contexts/<domain>.md` when present, then read the whole file before deciding early ambiguities.
4. **Run Stage 1 and inspect the real result.** Prefer explicit project domains plus `--apply-domain --json`. Read `deferred` and `review_enqueued`; never silently discard the sidecar or queue gap.
5. **Diff Stage 1 against raw/original.** If a rule changed correct speech, work from the original, retire the stored pair with `--report-false-positive "<from>" "<to>" --domain <domain>`, and verify it no longer fires.
6. **Triage every candidate.**
   - Confident: the sound change is plausible and context or an authoritative local source settles it.
   - Needs verification: a person, company, product, model, ticker, place, number, or other load-bearing term without a source.
   - Uncertain: evidence does not settle it; leave the original and enqueue.
   - Multi-channel entity fork: when independent transcripts disagree on a person name or other proper noun and no local authority settles it, collect the unresolved forks and ask the human once. Do not guess, and do not treat a majority vote as identity evidence.
7. **Apply the smallest edit that explains the sound.** Do not add words the speaker did not say. Correct ASR-derived metadata too, while leaving `asr_note` intact. A Stage 1 deferral you now agree with is closed through its queue row, not re-applied with sed: `--resolve-review <id> --decision accepted` (ids from `--list-review --review-file "<absolute-canonical-file>" --json`) performs the edit, or records a fix you already applied by hand without writing. Either way the row ends `accepted`; `kept_original` asserts the transcript was right as spoken and is never the exit for a fix you applied.
8. **Run a second pass.**
   - Every tier: run `--scan-traps` and inspect both hits and `unparsed`.
   - Full tier: use fresh-context review. For a single unsplit review, assign one corrected file and require a compact residual table or explicit `no new residuals`; an empty/truncated response is a failed review.
   - For a split, multi-file, or resumed Full review, follow [native_review_packets.md](references/native_review_packets.md) for packet assignment, JSON results, validation, and recovery.
   - High-stakes multi-recording: a sampled clip settles only that anchored item. If the user asked for a higher-quality or complete transcript and the baseline audio is available, load **`/daymade-audio:asr-transcribe-to-text`** and run its full-file transcription path across the complete clearest/canonical recording before claiming whole-transcript coverage; otherwise report `sampled cross-check only — incomplete`. Prefer a recognizer different from the producer of the canonical body. If only the same recognizer is available, the run proves complete-source coverage but is not independent cross-recognizer corroboration; state that boundary.
9. **Enqueue every unresolved item; escalate selectively.** First apply [evidence selection and escalation](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md#evidence-selection-and-escalation), then follow `Review queue safety` below and [review_queue_dashboard.md](references/review_queue_dashboard.md). Open only this file when human review is needed. Detection and enqueueing are not correction: for a higher-quality/final claim, every queue row anchored to this exact file must leave `pending`. For human review, start the dashboard with `uv run scripts/review-dashboard/server.py --file "<absolute-canonical-file>"`; add `--item <id>` to land on one fork. If a human is unavailable, keep the artifact explicitly labeled `draft / unresolved — incomplete` and enumerate the rows; do not ship the raw suspect text under a completed quality claim.
10. **Read back the human state, then finalize.** When the human says they marked the dashboard, do not rerun ASR or ask the same questions again. First run `uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py --list-review --review-file "<absolute-canonical-file>" --review-status all --json`, apply any resulting file state, and require `stats.pending_total == 0` for that exact path; zero pending rows is required before the high-quality/final claim. Then diff the file actually edited, run numeric consistency when numbers matter, rerun plain Stage 1, re-grep known corrections, and confirm every change traces to a triage decision. Global queue counts cannot close or reopen this file's quality claim. Last, run `--close-sidecars --input "<absolute-canonical-file>"`: it re-reads every `*_changes.md`/`*_needs_review.md` entry against the file and the queue, refuses while an entry still reads as the original without a verdict or any row is pending, and removes the sidecars only when everything is closed (see `Finalization`).
    **Authority for a person-name verdict travels in `--authority`, never in `--note`.**
    `--note` is your reason; `--authority` is the citable source appended to the item's
    `evidence` **before the name-convergence guard reads it** (roster 行 / group
    displayName+nickName double-read / 用户裁决 / 音证). A person-name
    `accepted`/`overridden` written without it is refused; a `kept_original` resting on
    such a source leaves the guard nothing to read and leaves `evidence` still asserting
    the enqueue-time doubt. Real case 2026-09-22: two queue rows for one nickname were
    settled with the citation in `--note`, so `--show-review` read `evidence` =
    "待用户确认" beside `decision_note` = resolved — one item carrying both "unresolved"
    and "settled" state. Repair with `--attach-authority ID --authority-text TEXT`, which
    appends and never rewrites. The two commands cannot share one line:
    `--attach-authority` and `--resolve-review` together are refused, because the natural
    one-liner "verified it, now settle it" ran only the append, printed ✅, exited 0 —
    and never recorded the verdict while telling the caller it had.
11. **Compound the learning in the same turn.** Route each stable pattern to its correct home; do not leave confirmed fixes only in chat. Native-pass edits never reach Stage 1's correction history, so harvest them mechanically right after the final diff:

    ~~~bash
    # Diff raw vs corrected into parseable trap candidates (review artifact —
    # you adjudicate the printed list; --write auto-appends only the recurring
    # (≥2x) non-bare candidates; --write-all also appends the one-off set)
    uv run scripts/harvest_corrections.py raw.md corrected.md \
      --context-file ~/.transcript-fixer/contexts/<domain>.md
    ~~~

    Every emitted bullet is round-trip verified through the real trap parser before printing, and pairs already documented in the context file are skipped. A pair the bullet grammar cannot carry — a side with no lexical content or a `*` in it, such as a vendor's `***` redaction mask diffed against the real word — is dropped at the noise filter, and any bullet that still fails to parse is reported on stderr and excluded rather than aborting the run. High-frequency candidates are strong traps; single-occurrence ones need a human judgment — that is why `--write` leaves them out by default — and ⚠️ 裸形 candidates are never auto-written. This replaces hand-writing trap bullets from memory.
12. **Propagate entity fixes deliberately.**

    First finish the same-file sweep: inspect `harvest_corrections.py --json`
    entries with nonzero `remaining`, then check the observed spelling family of
    each confirmed entity or technical identifier across body and ASR-derived
    metadata. Use the authoritative spelling and conventional filename casing;
    a user's informal dictation is not a request to preserve a typo. Preserve real
    alternate referents, aliases, and generic-character hits. Do not turn a
    same-file sweep into an unreviewed batch replacement or repeat settled questions. Then search
    only the owning project’s derived notes/summaries and review every hit; exclude
    raw ASR and correction sidecars because they preserve the evidence trail.

The detailed provenance bar, local-first entity ladder, second-pass prompt, queue payload, and finalization rules are in [references/native_ai_full_workflow.md](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md).

## Cross-skill caller contract

A caller pipeline must:

1. Run Stage 1 with the explicitly configured project domain(s), `--apply-domain`, and `--json`. If `deferred > review_enqueued`, persist the review sidecar outside any temporary directory or surface the gap as failure.
2. Run Native AI with this skill loaded, or report `Stage 1 only — incomplete`. Agent-less automation may use Stage 3 instead.

Canonical call:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --input "$staged" --stage 1 \
  --domain "$domains" --apply-domain --json
~~~

A caller that wires only the script path never loads this contract. Script-path integration alone is therefore a Stage 1 prefilter, not transcript correction.

Keep project domains warm: every confirmed recurring correction from the native pass must be added back to the correct project domain, roster, or context file.

## Dictionary and identity safety

Read [references/false_positive_guide.md](references/false_positive_guide.md) and [references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md](references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md) before adding a rule.

| Pattern | Destination |
|---|---|
| Stable non-word or unique garble → canonical term | `--add ... --domain <project>` |
| Important recurring person and observed ASR variants | People roster |
| Correction right only inside a specific recurring phrase | `--add-context-rule PATTERN REPLACEMENT --domain <project>` (regex, domain-scoped; omit `--domain` for global) |
| Common/real word wrong only under a cue | Domain context trap, never a bare rule (a bare number or a single surname + 老师/总 is refused at roster load and by `--add` / `--import`, `--force` included) |
| Real name → different real name | Domain context + human/audio verification, never a bare rule |
| Confirmed-correct entity repeatedly reopened | Confirmed-correct context record |
| One-off sentence-local wording | Edit only; do not add |

Stage 1's match-time layer (the third of the three layers in [references/false_positive_guide.md](references/false_positive_guide.md): add time, apply time, match time) also refuses a dictionary match on its own at three checks before risk scoring: the superset check (the corrected form is already in place), the common-word boundary check for short rules, and the word-boundary check. That last one asks, by script, whether the match is a fragment of real words: an ASCII match with an ASCII letter directly beside it is inside a longer word (`Cloud` in `iCloud`; digits do not count, so `cloud3` still corrects); a CJK match is refused only when every segment of a dictionary-only jieba cut that overlaps it is a multi-character word and one of them crosses the match boundary (新一 in 更新|一下, 问题记 in 问题|记录, 同龄 in 同龄人) — one single-character segment under the match (巨|神智|能, 叫|新|一下|单) means an unknown fragment and the match proceeds. Refusals are counted as `Refused at word boundaries` and in the JSON `boundary_refused`, listed in the Stage 1 summary, and never deferred. The CJK half needs jieba; without it the check silently would not run, so it now says so — stderr warning, `CHECK OFF` in the summary, and `boundary_check_active: false` in the JSON, because `boundary_refused: 0` alone cannot tell a clean run from a disarmed one. A context rule (`--add-context-rule`) skips this check but still goes through risk scoring, so in safe mode its match is deferred to the review queue rather than applied — accept it there, or run `--apply-all`, which switches the check off and applies every match; `--apply-domain` keeps the check. The layers are listed in [references/false_positive_guide.md](references/false_positive_guide.md).

A context trap is a cue, not permission to replace blindly. Two annotation classes in a domain context file are **machine-readable vetoes that Stage 1 enforces** (when the domain is named via `--domain` — a whole-library run has no owner to veto with): a trap marked `禁裸词`/`禁入词典` demotes any dictionary rule with the same FROM to review, and a confirmed-correct （勿修） record demotes any rule whose FROM is that token — demotion beats `--apply-domain` trust-flattening, so a real-word rule (the 绿点→绿电 class: right in business context, wrong in UI context) can stay in the dictionary without firing blindly. `--apply-all` remains the operator's explicit override. Without the veto the only escape was `--report-false-positive`, which disables the rule in the contexts where it is right too. `--scan-traps` supports canonical `→` and legacy `≈` mappings with the same directional contract: left is observed ASR, right is intended text. Wrap an exact FROM phrase containing spaces in backticks:

~~~markdown
- **`CC 思维链`/`CC 思维连` → 目标术语** — only under the domain's documented cue
~~~

This demonstrates an exact ASR phrase candidate, not a person-name candidate. The domain context remains the authority for the real target and cue; the scanner only locates the literal FROM forms.

Before adding any real-word-shaped rule, measure the project corpus:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --probe "candidate" --corpus /path/to/project-transcripts/

uv run scripts/fix_transcription.py \
  --add "candidate" "canonical" --domain myproject \
  --check-corpus --corpus /path/to/project-transcripts/
~~~

User verdicts settle the occurrence immediately, but they do not make a replacement reusable. Fix the file first, then route the result through the table above: only a stable recurring pattern goes to the dictionary/roster/context; a rare sentence-local mishearing stays file-only. When the user confirms that two legitimate names or nicknames identify the same person, preserve whichever form was actually spoken and store the identity relationship as context, not as a replacement rule.

## Review queue safety

Read [references/review_queue_dashboard.md](references/review_queue_dashboard.md) before enqueueing or resolving.

Minimum item:

~~~json
[
  {
    "file": "/absolute/path/to/transcript.md",
    "line": 142,
    "original": "<suspect-token-only>",
    "suggested": "<best-candidate>",
    "kind": "entity",
    "context": "<verbatim sentence, or unique clause/span for same-line repeats>",
    "evidence": "<what was checked>"
  }
]
~~~

Safety rules:

- `file` is mandatory for this workflow. Without it, acceptance can record a verdict without editing the transcript.
- `original` is only the suspect token/span; never put the whole sentence there.
- `context` is copied verbatim; `line` is the key, not `line_hint`.
- `suggested` is the key, not `suggestion`. Use `actions`, not `action_pack`.
- Resolve one occurrence at a time; sweep sibling entity occurrences only after the whole batch is resolved.
- A `pending` row is a blocking state for a high-quality/final transcript, not proof that the issue was handled. Queue detection without a human/evidence verdict leaves the artifact incomplete.
- Read `resolved_text` after an override; the listing can still display the rejected suggestion.
- A single-line `asr_note` ledger is masked on the accept path too, so resolving an item never edits the provenance line that cites the old form. A fix you applied by hand before resolving is still closed with `--decision accepted` (or `overridden` for its override text): when the context recorded at enqueue reappears anywhere in the file with the suggestion in the slot the original occupied, the verdict is recorded without writing (`already in place at the anchor — recorded without writing`). Line drift does not matter, and neither does the original surviving in other utterances far from the hint, or inside the suggestion itself (阿里→阿里云). It fails closed with `ReAnchorNeeded`, and the message says which, when the original still sits within the resolve window of the hint outside the suggestion (the anchored utterance, or a look-alike beside it, is still garbled — settle that line on its own row or by hand, then resolve; do not `--reanchor-review` this row onto it), when the recorded neighbourhood also appears with a third form in the slot (anywhere in the file at the width that matched, or near the hint at any width down to two characters a side), or when the edit touched the characters next to the slot. What it cannot see: an anchored utterance deleted or rewritten past both neighbours while an identical one elsewhere reads corrected — that records `accepted` with nothing written, and a garble still in the file is re-deferred by the next Stage 1 run. `--reanchor-review <id>` repairs a row whose original moved or drifted and refuses one whose context already reads corrected.

**Choosing the exit when `accepted` refuses to write — three shapes, three exits.**
`accepted` is fail-closed by design: it declines to edit when the anchor is
ambiguous, and a refusal is information, not an obstacle to route around. Match
the exit to *why* it refused (2026-09-16: 9 rows hit these three shapes; picking
wrong cost six retries):

| What the refusal says | What actually happened | Correct exit |
|---|---|---|
| `anchor text not found` — original is simply gone from the file | Your earlier edit (or a sibling row's) already consumed it, and a grep of the **corrected form** confirms it landed | `skipped --note "<which row/edit consumed it; grep <newform> = N>"` |
| `anchor text appears more than once on line N` / `a different form there, so which line this row meant is ambiguous` | The line holds several instances of the variant; a whole-line replace already fixed all of them | `skipped --note "<the line-level replace that covered them; grep of both forms>"` |
| original is a **substring of a form an earlier row already replaced** (e.g. row A held `杨峰中`, this row holds `杨峰`) | The longer form went first, so this row's token vanished with it | `skipped --note "<row id that consumed it as a substring>"` |

The gate on all three is the same and it is not optional: **grep the corrected form
and confirm the old form reads zero before you close anything as `skipped`.** A
`skipped` row asserts "there is nothing left to fix here", so if the garble is
still in the file, `skipped` launders a real error into a closed row — the exact
outcome `Review queue safety` warns about. When the grep comes back non-zero, the
row is not skippable: fix the remaining occurrence by hand, then re-resolve.

`skipped` is also **not** the exit when you changed your mind and the original was
right as spoken — that is `kept_original`, and it asserts the transcript keeps the
raw form (so grep it still present). The two differ in what they claim about the
bytes on disk: `kept_original` = "original stays", `skipped` = "nothing to do,
already handled elsewhere". A row the queue can neither re-anchor nor recognise closes with `--decision skipped --note <what happened>`. `kept_original` asserts the transcript keeps the original form — never the exit for a fix you applied.
- If the file moved or drifted, run `--reanchor-review`. Add `--reanchor-root` or `--reanchor-to` when requested. Do not hand-edit around a pending item.
- Promote every `decision_note` by meaning; storing a note does not change the dictionary, roster, context, or false-positive state.
- The engine enforces the name-convergence gate at both write points: `--resolve-review --decision accepted/overridden` and a person-name-shaped `--add` refuse a target that is only someone's roster variant, or that nothing claims while the evidence names no authority (details and the sibling `--add` gates — open-row conflict, real-word probe — in [dictionary_identity_and_context.md](references/dictionary_identity_and_context.md)).

## Numbers, artifacts, and batches

Read [references/advanced_correction_evidence.md](references/advanced_correction_evidence.md) when any of these conditions holds:

- A number, bound, price, share, deadline, or magnitude drives a decision.
- Two recordings exist for one meeting.
- A load-bearing name or term survived the local ladder unresolved, source audio is available, and the current authorization already permits a second recognizer.
- A whiteboard, slide, or photographed written artifact can independently settle a name/term.
- Several related files should share one correction list.
- A 10+ file batch is being delegated.

Numeric-slot scan:

~~~bash
uv run scripts/scan_numeric_consistency.py transcript.md --domain myproject
~~~

Its output is candidates, never automatic edits. For a load-bearing number, follow [evidence selection and escalation](references/native_ai_full_workflow.md#evidence-selection-and-escalation). When original audio is accessible, use the review dashboard to decide by ear. Otherwise retain competing readings unless other evidence settles them, and continue the remaining items; do not require export permission.

For delegated batches, every agent owns one file, cannot cross-file replace, and returns a residual list. Afterward compare `git diff --name-only` with the explicit file list and inspect every unexpected file under the repository's worktree-safety rules.

## Finalization

- Native mode edits the original file directly. Rerun plain `--stage 1` to confirm; a clean no-op writes no Stage 1 sidecar.
- When a newer `*_stage1.md` exists and the original was not edited after it, a plain Stage 1 rerun atomically promotes it and removes disposable sidecars. It retains `*_changes.md` and `*_needs_review.md`: those are review evidence, and `--close-sidecars` is the command that decides they are closed. `--apply-all` never takes this promotion path.
- Do not use the existence of an output file as the success signal; read JSON/exit status and independently read the final file.
- Preserve raw transcripts, `*_changes.md`, and `*_needs_review.md` as evidence until `--close-sidecars --input "<absolute-canonical-file>"` reports `closed`: every entry reads applied in the file (or the original form no longer appears anywhere in the ledger-masked transcript) or is answered by a decided queue row for this exact file — one row per occurrence, matched by nearest line, so a second occurrence with no row of its own stays undecided — or belongs to a FROM→TO rule that has since been disabled as a false positive (`disabled`: no longer a question), and the file has zero pending rows. It exits 1 (`open`) naming the undecided entries and pending ids, 2 (`blocked`) when a `*_stage1.md` newer than the file still awaits the plain Stage 1 rerun or a report carries entries the parser cannot read (an unreadable report is evidence, not an empty one), and 0 after removing the evidence and stale run outputs. For an entry that still reads as the original and has no row at all, `--decide-raw kept_original|skipped --by <who> --note <why>` records the verdict through the queue at closure — an audit trail, not a silent deletion. `--dry-run` shows the verdict without deleting; `--json` returns it.
- `*_stage2.md` and `*_dryrun.md` are run-scoped outputs of the API route and the preview, not archive material: promote or discard them in the session that produced them. One newer than the transcript is unpromoted — `--close-sidecars` retains it, says so, and removes it only with `--discard-unpromoted`.
- Re-grep a known corrected form in the final file and verify no correction remains only in `asr_note` or a sidecar.
- If a queued item was renamed away, repair it with `--reanchor-review` rather than resolving it with a false terminal verdict.

## Agent-less API route

Only when no Claude/Codex agent can perform Native AI Correction:

~~~bash
export GLM_API_KEY="<api-key>"
uv run scripts/fix_transcript_enhanced.py input.md --output ./corrected
~~~

The route writes `<stem>_stage2.md` beside the input. It is this run's output, not a second transcript: verify it, then promote it onto the transcript or discard it before the session ends. A `_stage2.md` left beside a transcript that is not it cannot be told apart from reviewed work a month later.

Read [references/glm_api_setup.md](references/glm_api_setup.md), [references/installation_setup.md](references/installation_setup.md), and the explicitly API-oriented portions of [references/workflow_guide.md](references/workflow_guide.md). When a chunk fails after retries, the API route keeps that chunk and its original surrounding separators byte-for-byte and prints a warning; if every chunk fails, the complete output equals the input. For `fix_transcription.py --stage 2|3 --json`, read the additive `stage2_total_chunks`, `stage2_failed_chunks`, and `stage2_degraded` fields: `stage2_degraded: true` is not a fully corrected run even though the safely retained artifact is emitted. The enhanced wrapper exits nonzero after writing that retained artifact when any Stage 2 chunk is degraded. Verify the output rather than assuming the warning means a corrected result exists.

The enhanced API wrapper can also add paragraph breaks, reduce repeated filler,
and present corrections for interactive review. Those are API-wrapper features;
they do not authorize Native AI to rewrite wording for fluency.

## Handoff

After correction, hand off to `/daymade-audio:meeting-minutes-taker` only when the user wants a structured summary. Do not create meeting minutes automatically: transcript correction and summarization are separate scopes.
