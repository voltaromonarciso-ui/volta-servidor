"""Enumerate every rich-media reference in a fetched Feishu document body.

This is the recursion engine's core for Path A (lark-cli API extraction). A
collection/hub is a doc whose body references other docs; missing one
reference means a missing document — the single biggest hub-scraping failure.
Hand-rolled `grep | sed` pipelines repeatedly missed the `my.feishu.cn`
personal-space pattern, so this enumeration is centralized and tested here.

Covers: mention-doc (real raw tag is `<cite doc-id=... file-type=...
title=...>`, verified 2026-08-17 — see RE_CITE_TAG), sheet, image (real raw
tag is `<img src=... alt=...>`, verified 2026-08-17 — see RE_IMG_TAG), file,
whiteboard (`<whiteboard token=...>` — an inline diagram block, NOT a
followable reference, see DISPATCH["whiteboard"]), lark-table, and
cross-tenant / personal-space / Minutes / Tencent-Meeting URLs.

Input : the fetched Feishu body. On lark-cli builds where `.data.markdown` is
        non-null (<=1.0.32; unconfirmed whether still reachable on any
        current build, see SKILL.md Path A step 3), that Markdown is a valid
        input. Otherwise (`.data.markdown` is null -- the current default,
        verified null in 11/11 real documents checked including the
        currently-installed lark-cli 1.0.80) the body only reaches disk as
        raw HTML via `.data.document.content`; run this script on THAT saved
        `source.html`, never on the pandoc-converted `source.md` -- pandoc
        silently strips several of these tags with zero trace (whiteboard
        and mention-doc confirmed; see SKILL.md Path A step 3's callout).
Output: JSON array on stdout, one object per *distinct* reference:
        {"type": ..., "ref": <token-or-url>, "title": ..., "dispatch": <hint>}
        plus a human summary on stderr.

It only *enumerates*. Dispatching/fetching each reference is the caller's job
(see references/lark-cli-api-extraction.md, Step 5 dispatch table) -- except
`whiteboard`, which is never fetched or recursed, only exported and read as
an image (see SKILL.md Path A step 4).

Usage:
    python3 feishu_extract_refs.py FETCHED_BODY.html   # prefer the raw HTML
    python3 feishu_extract_refs.py FETCHED_BODY.md      # only if no .html was saved
    python3 feishu_extract_refs.py FETCHED_BODY.html --type docx   # filter

# pseudo-tags this script originally assumed (RE_MENTION_DOC, RE_IMAGE_TAG --
# never observed in real raw HTML, but retained since nothing was verified

# `.data.document.content` HTML shapes (RE_CITE_TAG, RE_IMG_TAG) that replace
# them on the current default (pandoc) path. Run this script on source.html
# for the latter -- see the module docstring.

# --- mention-doc references -------------------------------------------------
# Verified 2026-08-17 (lark-cli 1.0.80, fresh fetch of a real hub doc; the
# same byte-identical tag structure independently corroborated in an
# archived 2026-07-25 fetch of a different doc -- 6 weeks apart, same
# doc-id) against real `.data.document.content` raw HTML: the tag is NOT
# `<mention-doc token="..." type="...">Title</mention-doc>`. It is an
# empty-bodied <cite> tag with the title in an ATTRIBUTE, not inner text:
#   <cite doc-id="<DOC_ID>" file-type="wiki"
#         title="Example Doc Title" type="doc"></cite>
# Keep placeholders in this example: the real token it used to show was a
# live internal document id (scrubbed 2026-09-18) -- never paste live
# doc/media tokens into this file.
# Confirmed file-type values: "wiki", "docx" (both independently verified
# against real documents). `pandoc -f html -t gfm` makes this tag VANISH
# WITH ZERO TRACE -- not even the bare title text survives (worse than
# losing just the token/type) -- so this pattern is only useful against raw
# HTML (source.html), never against a pandoc-converted .md.
RE_CITE_TAG = re.compile(r'<cite\b(?=[^>]*\bdoc-id=)[^>]*>')

# Legacy `<mention-doc token="..." type="...">Title</mention-doc>` pseudo-tag.
# Never observed in raw `.data.document.content` HTML across 11 real
# documents checked (2026-08-17) -- but nothing was verified about what the
# <=1.0.32 `.data.markdown` branch emits when it fires (no non-null
# `.data.markdown` response was found to inspect). Retained, not removed, as
# that branch's only coverage; costs zero false positives since this literal
# shape does not occur in raw HTML.
RE_MENTION_DOC = re.compile(
    r'<mention-doc\s+token="([^"]+)"\s+type="([^"]+)"\s*>([^<]*)</mention-doc>'

# --- sheet references --------------------------------------------------
# UNVERIFIED -- no real document containing an actual sheet/spreadsheet
# reference was found (9 real documents inspected, 2026-08-17). Left
# unchanged: do not guess-fix a pattern with no positive evidence. If sheet
# references turn out to use the same <cite file-type="sheet"> shape as
# mention-doc (a plausible but unconfirmed extrapolation), the
# "mention-doc-other" bucket below will still surface them with the real
# file-type value visible for manual triage, rather than silently
# mis-tagging them as a confirmed fact.
RE_SHEET_TAG = re.compile(r'<sheet\s+token="([^"]+)"\s*/?>')

# --- image references -------------------------------------------------------
# Verified 2026-08-17 (fresh fetch of a real docx, byte-identical to an
# archived 2026-07-25 fetch of the same doc) against real raw HTML: the tag
# is NOT `<image token="...">`. It is a standard-shaped self-closing <img>
# element with the drive token in `src=`, not `token=`:
#   <img id="..." name="filename.jpeg" alt="<long AI-generated description>"
#        height="1920" href="https://internal-api-drive-stream.feishu.cn/..."
#        mime="image/jpeg" scale="0.288889" src="<MEDIA_TOKEN>"
#        width="1080"/>
# Same scrub rule as the <cite> example above: <MEDIA_TOKEN> stands in for a
# real drive token that was live internal data -- do not paste real ones.
# Unlike mention-doc, this does NOT vanish under pandoc: `pandoc -f html -t
# gfm` re-serializes the whole <img> as raw HTML passthrough (src/id/href/
# width/height/alt survive verbatim; `name=` is dropped; `mime=`/`scale=` are
# renamed `data-mime=`/`data-scale=` -- observed once cleanly, not proven
# universal across pandoc versions). So this pattern also works against a
# pandoc-converted source.md in practice, but source.html remains the one to
# trust (unlike RE_CITE_TAG above, which does NOT survive pandoc at all).

# RE_SHEET_TAG above.
RE_FILE_TAG = re.compile(r'<file\s+token="([^"]+)"[^>]*>([^<]*)</file>')

# --- whiteboard (inline diagram, NOT a followable reference) ----------------
# Verified 2026-08-16 against a real document (3 tags in raw HTML, 0 trace
# in the pandoc-converted .md of the same doc). This is Feishu's native
# diagram/flowchart block, inlined in the current doc -- it is never
# fetched/recursed like mention-doc/sheet; see DISPATCH["whiteboard"] and
# SKILL.md Path A step 4 for the export+Read handling.

# --- inline tables -----------------------------------------------------
# Verified 2026-08-17: ordinary docx tables use plain, standard HTML5
# `<table>` markup, NOT a custom `<lark-table>` tag (0 occurrences of
# `<lark-table` across 9 real documents inspected). Contrary to the original
# assumption, pandoc does NOT collapse them into unstructured run-together
# text: tables whose cells hold single-paragraph content convert cleanly to
# GFM pipe-table syntax; tables with multi-paragraph cells fall back to a
# single embedded raw `<table>...</table>` HTML block (still structurally a
# table, just not pipe-syntax) -- observed in one real document (8 tables),
# not proven universal (colspan/rowspan not present in that sample). Because
# ordinary tables are common and mostly survive intact, this regex is
# deliberately NOT repointed at bare `<table` -- every healthy document has
# `<table>` tags, so that would turn the acceptance-gate check (SKILL.md
# Path A step 5) into constant false positives on completely healthy
# extractions. Left matching the literal (and, per this evidence, likely
# nonexistent-in-this-form) `<lark-table` tag, which costs nothing since it
# was already never observed to fire on real content; it may name an
# embedded Bitable/Base-view object not yet encountered, or may not exist in
# the current Feishu docx export format at all.
