# Original media and Markdown reader handoff

## Select the failure branch

The executing agent records the selected account/profile and operation before
classifying an error. A document read, attachment export and original preview
are separate operations. Preserve the error JSON/stderr outside the public bundle.

| Observation | Next action | Stop condition |
|---|---|---|
| Selected identity cannot read the body (`131006`) | Use the existing permission/owner-export route | Do not replay credentials or guess an alternate token |
| Body is readable; media export is denied and the CLI recommends preview | Read the installed CLI's media-preview guide; attempt that authorized operation once | Preview permission refusal is a boundary, not a transport retry |
| Preview returns `INTERNAL_ERROR` / unexpected EOF | Inspect the same source in an already authorized browser session | No identical retry loop; do not label EOF as an ACL refusal |
| Browser actually plays/displays the requested original | Capture its observed original request URL and narrowly scoped headers through the browser owner | No invented URL, token enumeration, login-wall bypass or cross-account credential borrowing |
| No authorized original request is available | Retain text and source token; report the media gap | Do not claim an original was saved |

This branch was exercised with lark-cli 1.0.96 on 2026-10-07: body capture worked,
export was refused, CLI preview failed in transport, and the authorized browser's
original request returned matching byte ranges. It establishes that branch on
those sources, not universal availability. The older docx CLI failures through
1.0.32 remain scoped to their tested commands and release.

## Download one original per destination

The agent prepares a private mode-0600 request JSON outside the archive/Git tree.
Use the URL and headers actually observed for the selected original. Supply
`identity` as its stable token plus captured source revision, `size` from original
metadata, and `width`/`height` together for video. `sha256` is optional when a
previous independently verified original hash exists. Never store cookies or
temporary signed URLs in the durable manifest or print the request file.

```bash
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/download_original_preview.py \
  <private-request.json> <archive>/media/<original-name.mp4>
```

Expected: `status=complete`, exact `bytes`, `sha256`, `proxy=false`, and matching
video dimensions/duration. An existing verified original returns
`already_verified`; a competing writer is refused. A failed transfer retains
`.part` and its range journal. Resume with the same source identity and output;
corrupted local chunks are downloaded again. A changed identity/layout is refused.
If a signed request expires, recapture the same authorized original request;
do not clear state or launch a second writer. Missing ffprobe for video is a
dependency gap. Remove the task-owned private request file after use.

The helper is POSIX-only, uses an explicit empty proxy handler and rejects
cross-host redirects carrying browser credentials. It accepts only exact HTTP
206 ranges with matching `Content-Range` and byte counts, following
[HTTP range semantics](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-range).
It never accelerates, transcodes, uploads or chooses durable storage. Record the
stable source locator and verification in the existing archive manifest. Its
`.verified.json` sidecar is local verification state, not source authority.

## Render the captured body

Keep the original API JSON/HTML unchanged. For an Obsidian deliverable, place the
verified originals under that archive's `media/`, then run the actual pandoc path:

```bash
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/render_api_capture.py \
  <document-fetch.json> <archive-manifest.json> <archive>/<new-pilot-name.md> \
  --source <original-feishu-url>
```

Expected: `status=converted_reader_pending`, nonzero `media_references` when the
source contains media, and `actual_reader=not_verified`. The output note must
remain under the manifest's archive directory; an outside output is refused. The helper localizes img/source tokens from the
manifest, preserves image alt text, converts attachment figures to native
Markdown embeds plus filename links, and refuses missing originals/overwrites.
It does not resolve whiteboards or replace the reference-graph worklist. Continue
the existing raw-HTML residual check within the user's selected capture scope.

Before expanding a batch, the agent opens this pilot in the recipient's real
Obsidian reading canvas: inspect images and captions, briefly play each affected
video, follow a filename link, then reopen the note. Coordinate window ownership
before native input. User-performed acceptance is valid; record it as such.
When the reader is unavailable or concurrently occupied, keep that observation
pending instead of substituting a standalone image tab, parser or qmd result.
Use frontend-visual-qa's Markdown reader handoff for the actual-reader protocol.

Native embedding follows [Obsidian's embed contract](https://obsidian.md/help/embeds).
Keep local asset references relative to the Markdown directory so moving the
delivered folder as a unit preserves them. A hidden global cache is not the
reader-facing attachment directory. Keep source/Git/OSS authority and binary
ignore/LFS policy with the archive storage owner; do not change it merely to
make the note display. Download, conversion, actual-reader and search checks
remain separate observations.

## Delivery completion gate

The executing agent runs `check_reader_delivery.py` before declaring a local
reader-facing archive complete. Conversion exit 0 establishes conversion only.
Use the actual user-selected delivery root and reader; do not choose a hidden
cache as that root to make a bad note pass. The root is the folder the recipient
can move as a unit. Keep the storage manifest current before this check.

```bash
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/check_reader_delivery.py inspect \
  --root <archive> --manifest <archive>/manifest.json \
  --note '<entry-note.md>' --reader Obsidian --report <private-inspect.json>
```

Repeat `--note` for every delivered entry note. Expected: `status=reader_pending`,
`actual_reader=not_verified`, and the examined note/file counts. The helper parses
GFM/reference links and Obsidian wikilinks with actual pandoc, follows linked local
Markdown, and checks every referenced local file against the manifest's bytes
and SHA-256. Absolute/file URLs, escaping paths, symlinks, missing targets, external
media embeds and raw-HTML media are refused. Remote source hyperlinks, anchors,
code examples and text-only notes remain valid. This byte/closure check is not a
visual or playback verdict. A video thumbnail or play button alone is not playback:
observe time advancing and decoded frames/audio; if the actual reader buffers or
reports failure, leave playback unverified and record the failure.

Perform the real-reader protocol above on that snapshot. Preserve native tool
observations/captures or the user's actual acceptance message outside the public
Skill. Reader evidence JSON supplies `kind` (`native-reader-observation` or
`user-acceptance`), exact `reader`, `artifact_fingerprint` from inspect,
`source_reference` to the original observation/message, and timezone-aware
`observed_at` after inspection. User acceptance also needs the exact `quote` and
`entry_notes` matching inspect; do not retroactively bind an old approval to new
bytes. Native evidence needs one `observations` row per inspected note, including
linked local Markdown: `note`,
`images_displayed`, `videos_played`, `links_opened` lists covering the inspected
paths and `reopened=true`, plus `evidence_files` with absolute `path` and `sha256`
for retained native captures/tool records. Missing checks are unfinished work.

```bash
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/check_reader_delivery.py record-reader \
  --report <private-inspect.json> --evidence <private-reader-evidence.json> \
  --receipt <private-reader-receipt.json>
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/check_reader_delivery.py finalize \
  --root <archive> --manifest <archive>/manifest.json \
  --note '<entry-note.md>' --reader Obsidian \
  --reader-receipt <private-reader-receipt.json>
```

Repeat the same entry-note set at finalize. Missing receipt returns exit 3 and
`reader_pending`; invalid paths, changed files/manifest/evidence, incomplete
observation coverage or a different reader return exit 1. Exit 0 with
`ready_with_reader_evidence` means current bytes and retained observation
coverage agree. Re-rendering or updating a note, asset, source manifest or entry
set invalidates that binding. Do not overwrite old inspect/evidence files;
retain the earlier result and create a new snapshot for a new real observation.

The gate cannot authenticate who wrote an observation or decide that screenshots
actually show readable images or playing video. It prints
`provenance_authenticated=false` even on a healthy finish. The agent must obtain
and inspect the named original evidence; invented JSON or its own unsupported
"checked" statement is not reader acceptance. This is a workflow-local completion
command, not a global Stop hook or a claim of universal behavior enforcement.

## Declare a selected personal collection

When the user has selected the destination and requested personal favorites,
the source producer can publish the captured body catalog there:

```bash
uv run --script <skill-dir>/scripts/build_manual_catalog.py <source-archive-root> \
  --collection fav-feishu --display-name '<selected-source-name>' --share-scope private
```

Expected: `status=declared`, the actual item count and `share_scope=private`.
The producer creates `_data/source.json` and `_data/items.jsonl` from explicit
Feishu source/qmd identities and body hashes. Markdown bodies remain unchanged;
no classification or team promotion occurs. Do not label a manually selected
course as a subscription. The lock file is transient local state; ignore it
according to the destination's existing policy. Rebuild the catalog after body
changes. Hand its parent directory to favorites-search's `--manual-favorites`
registration entry; that consumer validates rather than reconstructs the catalog.
