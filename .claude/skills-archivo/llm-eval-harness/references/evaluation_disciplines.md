# Evaluation Disciplines — why the probes work the way they do

Every rule below exists because skipping it produced a wrong number in a real evaluation.
They are cheap to follow and expensive to ignore.

## 1. Pass keys by env-var name, never on the command line

`--key-env MY_KEY` reads the value at runtime; `--key sk-...` would put the secret into
`ps` output, shell history, and any command echoed into a log or a saved report. The probes
read `os.environ[name]` and never print or persist the value. Corollary: never hardcode a
key into a use-case file, a wrapper script, or a fallback like `key = os.environ.get("X") or
"sk-real..."` — that last pattern is exactly how live keys leak into public repos.

## 2. Thinking-aware throughput — the inflated-tokens/sec trap

Reasoning models (o1-style, R1-style, many "flash" variants) stream their chain-of-thought
in a separate delta field (`reasoning_content`, sometimes `reasoning`), but the `usage.
completion_tokens` count **includes** those thinking tokens.

The failure mode: collect only the visible `content`, measure time-to-first-*content*-token
as TTFT, then divide `completion_tokens` by the remaining time. The thinking tokens were
generated during what you labeled "TTFT", so you attribute a huge token count to a tiny
window. A real ~750 tok/s model measured as **4700 tok/s** this way — a 6× overcount.

The fix the speed probe implements:
- TTFT = first token of **either** kind (thinking or content).
- decode throughput = `completion_tokens / (total − TTFT)` — total output over the whole
  decode window, thinking included. This is the honest "how fast does it generate" number.
- Report real-task throughput AND the sustained-decode ceiling separately. They differ
  legitimately: short outputs never reach steady state, so real-task numbers are lower than
  the ceiling. Reporting only one of them misleads.

## 3. N ≥ 10 for any probabilistic feature

A single request cannot distinguish "feature not implemented" from "implemented but fires
with probability < 100%". One real Anthropic-compatible endpoint honored `thinking: enabled`
on only **~13%** of requests while two competitors hit 100%. A single sample would have
called it either "works" or "broken" — both wrong. Default `--repeat 10`; report the rate
and a three-state verdict (`fully-implemented` / `intermittent k/N` / `not-implemented`),
never a binary from one shot.

## 4. `Connection: close` — defeat load-balancer sticky routing

With HTTP keep-alive, repeated requests can ride one TCP connection that the vendor's load
balancer pins to a single upstream replica. You then sample one replica's behavior and miss
the cross-fleet distribution. A real protocol probe saw **0/10 with keep-alive vs 17/90 with
`Connection: close`** on the same endpoint — keep-alive made a partially-working feature look
completely broken. Force a fresh connection per request whenever you're measuring a rate.

This is the single most independently-rediscovered rule in this file: four unrelated codebases
(a protocol probe, two cache investigations, a system-prompt delivery investigation) each hit it
separately before it was written down. Whatever property you measure — thinking-block rate, cache
hits, field delivery — if it can vary per replica or per channel, connection reuse will hide the
variance. Treat "fresh connection per request" as the default for every rate measurement, not an
option to remember.

## 5. `trust_env=False` — isolate the endpoint from your proxy

If the environment has an HTTP/SOCKS proxy set, the client library will route every request
through it by default. You then measure the proxy's concurrency limit and the proxy's
(possibly cross-border) latency, not the model's. For a domestic endpoint behind a local
proxy this is the difference between "model does 50 concurrent at 0.4s" and a garbage number.
The concurrency probe sets `trust_env=False`; when measuring speed against a domestic API,
also strip proxy env vars for that run (`env -u http_proxy -u https_proxy …`).

**`env -u` is not enough under a TUN-mode proxy.** Tools like Shadowrocket / Clash in TUN
mode intercept at the network layer: they hand the SDK a fake-IP for the target host and
route the real connection through `utun`, so stripping `http_proxy` / `https_proxy` env vars
(which only defeat env-var-level proxying) still leaves you measuring the tunnel. Symptoms:
the target resolves to a `198.18.x.x` / `100.64.x.x` fake-IP, or latency to a domestic host
is implausibly uniform. To truly bypass: resolve the host's real IP via a public DNS, then
pin it at the socket (bind a physical interface + a `--resolve`-style connection, preserving
SNI) — equivalent to `curl --interface en0 --resolve host:443:<real-ip>`. And confirm it
mattered by measuring BOTH paths: if direct and via-tunnel come out the same, the tunnel was
already routing that host DIRECT and you got lucky — but you only learn that by testing both.

## 5b. Prefer the server's self-reported decode speed; client throughput lies under batch-flush

Some endpoints (notably speculative-decoding ones like DFlash) flush many tokens per SSE
chunk instead of one at a time, and separately expose a ground-truth decode rate in a `pd`
block inside `usage` (`decode_tokens_per_second`). Two consequences:
- The client-side decode throughput (`completion_tokens / (total − ttft)`) reads **~2× too
  high** when the stream is batch-flushed, because a batch of tokens lands in one instant and
  the client can't see the real per-token cadence. A real run measured 1407 tok/s client-side
  while the server self-reported ~890.
- So: **prefer the server's `decode_tokens_per_second` when present** (it knows its own GPU
  cadence), count tokens-per-chunk to detect batch-flush, and when batch-flushed without a
  server field, report END-TO-END throughput (`completion_tokens / total`) rather than a
  client-side "decode" number that flatters the model. `speed_probe.py` does all three.

## 6. Don't let the model grade itself

A model asked to score its own output anchors on having produced it and grades optimistically.
The same risk applies to a single external grader. The quality dimension uses **independent
blind judges** that never see each other's verdict — see `quality_blind_judge.md`.

## 7. Forensic discipline when reading results

The probes produce numbers; these habits keep you from believing wrong ones.

- **Separate measured from inferred.** "The endpoint returned `decode_tokens_per_second: 749`"
  is measured. "So the model does ~750 tok/s" is an inference that's only as good as the
  measurement conditions (network, load, sample size). State which is which.
- **An impossible number is an artifact, not a result.** Throughput far above the vendor's
  own claim, a protocol verdict from one sample, a "100% pass" on a use-case set you know is
  hard — investigate before reporting. The 4700 tok/s figure in §2 was caught exactly this way.
- **Output that hit `max_tokens` is truncated — its quality and throughput numbers are void.**
  The speed probe flags `truncated`; a truncated reasoning-model answer may be almost entirely
  thinking with the real answer cut off. Re-run with a higher cap before judging.
- **High keyword-hit-count ≠ lots of evaluation content.** When mining logs or transcripts for
  "did we test model X", a model name appearing thousands of times is usually request metadata
  (the session *ran on* that model), not test results. Grep the body, not the metadata, before
  concluding a model was benchmarked.
- **A negative claim needs exhaustive search, not one miss.** "We never tested model X" is a
  claim about non-existence — one failed grep doesn't prove it. Search variants (exact id,
  date-stamped snapshots, quantization suffixes) and separate "ran on it" from "tested it"
  before asserting absence. Getting this wrong wastes the user's trust on something they
  remember clearly.

## 8. Identical conditions for comparisons

Comparing two models only means something if the probes ran with identical flags — same
concurrency levels, same use-case set, same max_tokens, same proxy treatment, ideally the same
time window (load varies by hour). Change one variable and the "winner" may just be the one you
tested at 3am.

## 9. Availability verdicts: what a failed call does and does not prove

Four traps, each of which has shipped a false conclusion into a real document:

- **A generous `max_tokens` is part of the probe, not a tuning detail.** Reasoning models spend
  the budget on thinking BEFORE emitting text; a cap of a few dozen tokens returns HTTP 200 with
  empty content, which reads as "model broken". Probe with thousands (the availability probe
  defaults to 8192), and treat 200-with-empty-content as a budget artifact until proven otherwise.
- **"My invented ID returned 404" is not evidence of a missing capability.** A 404/400 on an ID
  that never existed tells you nothing about the vendor. Before writing any "unavailable" list,
  confirm each ID against the vendor's or model developer's official docs — current-generation
  names live past your training data, and suffixes (dated variants, `-preview`, tier names) decide
  routability. An "unavailable" list where half the IDs were invented is worse than no list.
- **The `/v1/models` listing is not the availability truth.** Real gateways route models the
  listing omits (and list models that error). Probe the IDs you care about directly.
- **A model's self-reported identity is worthless as routing evidence.** Models mis-identify
  themselves constantly — deny having a system prompt they received, claim to be a different
  vendor's model. Never write "the gateway serves a different model than advertised" on the
  strength of asking the model who it is.
- **The error's CLASS tells you what the gateway knows about the ID.** When a model fails
  on its native endpoint, fire the same model name at the vendor's *other* protocol
  endpoint and read the error class: a 400 whose message names the model ("this model is
  not enabled for the Chat Completions API, please use the Messages API") proves the ID is
  registered and routed — an unregistered ID earns a generic not-found / no-channel error
  instead. A closed-beta model once 500'd on its Messages endpoint while returning that
  naming 400 on the Chat Completions endpoint, which pinned the outage to the inference
  engine without ever asking the vendor "is this ID right?". Distinguish the classes
  before concluding: `engine_error` ≠ `not_found` ≠ `wrong_endpoint`.
- **A client-side marker is not a real model ID — never send it to a raw endpoint.** Some
  CLI clients append a suffix to the model-name *string in their own local config* that the
  client itself parses and strips before constructing the actual request — it never
  reaches the wire. Claude Code's `[1m]` is a concrete case: setting
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=some-model[1m]` makes Claude Code strip `[1m]` and add
  `context-1m-2025-08-07` to the `anthropic-beta` header, but the literal string
  `some-model[1m]` is never the value of the `model` field in the request body. Probing
  `--models some-model[1m]` against a raw endpoint tests a string that was never supposed
  to exist at that layer — the resulting `no-channel` verdict says nothing about the
  vendor and nothing about whether `[1m]`-style large-context handling works; it only
  proves the endpoint doesn't understand a client-internal token, which was never in
  question. If the goal is verifying large-context behavior, probe context capacity
  directly (a real needle-in-haystack request near the claimed limit, using the bare
  model ID) instead of round-tripping a client marker through the API. `availability_probe.py`
  warns on this pattern (bracket-suffixed IDs) but cannot catch every client's private
  convention — know which layer a string belongs to before you probe with it.

## 10. Calibrate the meter before believing it

Any instrument you use to judge delivery — token accounting, a log field, a usage counter — must
itself be validated **on the exact dimension you will read**, before its readings count as
evidence. Calibrating an adjacent dimension does not transfer: in one real investigation,
`input_tokens` was proven sensitive to user-message length, then trusted to judge system-prompt
delivery — but that gateway forwarded the system prompt while NOT counting it in usage, so the
"meter" branded a perfectly working model as 38%-broken and flipped the customer recommendation
backwards. A wrongly-oriented instrument is worse than a small sample: every repeat errs in the
same direction, so repetition only inflates confidence in the wrong answer. Behavioral evidence
(the canary echo) is the verdict; accounting evidence corroborates. When they disagree, say so in
the report — the disagreement is itself a finding (billing and forwarding out of sync).

## 11. Neutral canaries — identity and obedience probes carry confounds

To test whether an instruction channel (system prompt) is delivered, plant a fact the model could
never guess and ask for it back. But the fact must be **external to the model's identity**:
"your internal codename is X" collides with assistant identity/safety training, and some model
families will deny having a codename EVEN WHEN the system prompt arrived — indistinguishable from
non-delivery. Obedience probes ("reply with only the word OK") fail the other way: compliance
varies with the model's stylistic training, so non-compliance is temperament, not transport.
Neutral external facts ("this session's project number is X") get relayed without resistance.
When a probe involves the model's self-concept or its willingness to obey, the probe measures the
model's personality entangled with the channel — redesign it until refusing is not an option.

## 12. Time-varying systems: a single time slice is not a steady state

Gateways route across multiple upstream channels whose weights change. A delivery/compliance rate
measured once — even with a clean N≥10 — describes that hour, not the system: the same
model+format combination has measured 6/16, then 12/12, then 1/6 across one day (and the token
counts were strictly bimodal — payload fully counted or not at all, no middle — the signature of
mixed routing rather than noise). Two rules follow. (1) Before publishing any rate, re-sample in
a separate time window; write "unstable, varies by time" rather than freezing one window's number
into a doc that outlives it. (2) When two careful measurements disagree, FIRST check whether they
measured the same metric the same way (behavioral vs accounting, §10) — inventing "it must vary
over time" to reconcile a metric mismatch is how one investigation papered over its own
instrument error; time-variance must be demonstrated with same-metric multi-window data, never
assumed to make contradictions comfortable.

## 13. The probe is a suspect too

Before a probe's failure means anything, the probe must pass on a known-good control. This is §7's
forensic stance turned on your own tooling, and it recurs: a resident canary "detected an outage"
that was its own too-short fixed sleep; a shell pipeline "detected empty content" that was its own
quote-mangling of JSON (move JSON through files or direct HTTP libraries, never through shell
string interpolation); a cache A/B tool permanently FAILs one vendor whose API reports
cache_creation=0 unconditionally — a judging assumption that simply doesn't hold there. Two
habits: run every new probe against a model/vendor where the answer is known before pointing it
at the suspect; and when reusing a probe on a new vendor, re-verify its pass/fail assumptions
against that vendor's API semantics (then write the exclusion into the probe's NOT-FOR header so
the next person doesn't rediscover it).

## 14. Report the failure MODE, not just the failure rate

"90% success at concurrency 10" and "hard ceiling at 50 with instant clean 429s" can describe the
same vendor — and the second is far more usable. Failure modes differ in user impact by an order
of magnitude: a fast explicit 429 is retriable and nearly invisible; a silent TCP drop that hangs
20 seconds before timing out stalls a room full of workshop attendees. When a probe fails, record
HOW: status code vs hang, time-to-failure, retriable-or-not. And separate the ceiling's SHAPE:
a sharp knee (stable 100% → cliff) locates a hard limit; a gradual slide suggests load-dependent
degradation. Translate the number back into the real workload before concluding ("your peak is
6-8 concurrent; the knee is at 50 → 6-8x headroom") — a benchmark that stops at the number has
not answered the question that motivated it.

## 15. Interleave the control INSIDE the failure window

A control run once *before* the target batch leaves a rebuttal door open: "the endpoint was
having a bad hour when you measured the target — your control just missed it." Round-robin the
control **between** target samples instead (target, target, control, repeat × N). The control
then demonstrates endpoint/key/account health at the exact minutes the target was failing, and
"the endpoint flapped" stops being an available explanation. One batch of 30 requests —
10 × (target-plan-endpoint, target-payg-endpoint, control) — took under a minute and produced
20/20 target failures against 10/10 control passes; "20/20 vs 10/10 inside the same 50-second
window" reads as a single-glance proof instead of two claims about two different hours. This
strengthens §13's control discipline, not replaces it: the control still has to be a known-good
model on the same endpoint and key, and each request still gets a fresh connection (§4).

## 16. Reproduce from an independent network before blaming the vendor

"Your side is broken" always earns "your IP or account is throttled" as the counter. Two
requests — the failing target plus one control — re-run from a second egress (home broadband
vs the datacenter server, a phone hotspot vs office fiber) close that door for almost zero
cost. Same key, same payload, different source IP and ISP path: if both networks reproduce
the failure and both pass the control, IP-blocking, account-level routing, and path-specific
middleboxes are excluded in one stroke. Handle the key on the second machine the same way as
everywhere else (§1): a curl `--config` file with 0600 permissions keeps it out of `ps` and
shell history there too.

## 17. Change one axis at a time — a comparison across two axes proves nothing

When endpoint A behaves differently from endpoint B, it is tempting to explain the gap with
whatever also differs between them — but if TWO things differ at once (which model, which
reseller/gateway, which region, which SDK version…), the comparison cannot tell you which one
caused it. This produced a real wrong conclusion: a Kimi/Moonshot model via reseller X rejected
a `thinking` block replayed in history; the same model FAMILY (a different specific model) via
reseller Y accepted it. That comparison changed BOTH the model and the reseller at once, and it
was read as "reseller Y's gateway is just better" — a plausible-sounding, entirely wrong
conclusion. The comparison that actually held up changed **one axis**: same reseller, same
model, only... no — same reseller, byte-identical payload, **only the model varied**. That
isolated test showed the earlier "different reseller" model ALSO failed on the SAME reseller as
the original failure, and a THIRD model on that same reseller worked fine — pinning the cause to
the model, not the reseller, and revealing (§18) that it tracked a documented per-model vendor
parameter. **This second conclusion was ALSO wrong — see §19.** The single-axis fix below is
still correct as far as it goes; it just doesn't go far enough on its own.

**The fix**: before concluding "X is why A differs from B," list every axis that differs between
your two samples. If more than one does, that comparison is inadmissible as evidence — go run
the single-axis version (same reseller/gateway/region, vary only the suspected cause) before
writing the conclusion down. This is the same discipline as changing one variable in any
controlled experiment; the compatibility-probing setting just makes it easy to forget, because
"try a different vendor" and "try a different model" often happen in the same breath as you
reach for whatever's convenient to test next.

## 18. Check the vendor's own documentation for a NAMED parameter before ad-hoc probing

An unexplained accept/reject split across models or resellers is often not a mystery to solve
by more probing — it may already be a documented, named parameter in the vendor's own API
reference, one probe-round away from being found if you'd searched first. The Kimi/Moonshot
case in §17 APPEARED to resolve the instant the vendor's own model-integration guide was read:
it names a `preserve_thinking` parameter, defaulting ON for some models and OFF for others, and
the per-model defaults it lists correlated exactly with which models accepted vs. rejected the
replayed thinking block in the single-axis test. **This correlation was a coincidence, not the
real mechanism — see §19 for how real production data overturned it.** The technique below
(search vendor docs before ad-hoc probing) is still sound practice; the specific conclusion
drawn from it in this case was not.

**The fix**: when a compatibility question feels vendor/model-specific ("why does this one model
behave differently"), search the vendor's own API reference for a named parameter governing that
behavior BEFORE spending probe cycles guessing at it empirically — `WebSearch "<vendor> API
<capability> parameter"` or `WebFetch` the vendor's model-integration page. This is Retrieve
Before You Produce applied to compatibility debugging specifically: the vendor has almost
certainly already documented the axis you're trying to reverse-engineer through trial and error.
Empirical probing (§17) is still how you VERIFY the documented parameter actually behaves as
claimed on YOUR specific model/reseller/version — it's a confirmation step, not a replacement for
reading the docs first. **But "confirms on the reseller you tested" is not "confirms in general"
— read §19 before treating any single-reseller confirmation as the final answer.**

## 19. A single-axis test only rules out variation along the axis you actually varied

§17 and §18 together produced a plausible, evidence-backed, WRONG conclusion — worth keeping as
the canonical cautionary tale because every step in the chain looked individually correct. The
recap: §17's single-axis probe (same reseller — Qiniu — vary only the model) showed kimi-k2.6
rejecting a replayed thinking block and kimi-k2.7-code accepting it. §18 found this matched
Alibaba Bailian's documented `preserve_thinking` per-model default (off for k2.6, on for
k2.7-code). Both steps were real, reproducible observations. The conclusion drawn — "this is a
Moonshot-model-intrinsic property, so it applies wherever these models are accessed" — was
still wrong, and testing it against REAL PRODUCTION TRAFFIC is what caught it: scanning every
archived request to the vendor's OWN direct native endpoint (not a reseller) for the "rejecting"
model, with a genuine thinking block already in history, showed 982 of 1163 real requests
succeeding — the model was fine all along. The reseller (Qiniu) was the actual point of failure;
the "vendor-documented parameter" correlation had been a coincidence of Qiniu's own internal
per-model handling, not a universal property of the model itself.

**Why the single-axis test couldn't catch this**: holding an axis constant to isolate a variable
(§17) proves which axis matters *within the value you held it at*. It proves nothing about what
happens if that held-constant value changes. "Same reseller, vary the model" tells you the model
matters *when accessed through that one reseller* — it is silent on whether the reseller itself
also matters, because the reseller was never varied. A vendor-documented parameter correlating
with your result (§18) raises the confidence that the axis you tested is real, but a
reseller-side implementation detail can produce the identical-looking correlation for entirely
its own reasons (e.g. the reseller might route different models through different internal code
paths with different bugs) — the correlation does not distinguish "this is the vendor's real
behavior" from "this reseller's bug happens to track the vendor's documented default."

**The fix**: when a probe is confined to one endpoint/reseller/environment and something more
authoritative is available — the vendor's own direct/native endpoint, real production traffic,
an independent second reseller — check it before writing "this is a model/vendor property" into
anything, even when the single-axis result already matches vendor documentation. Rank evidence
by authority, highest first: (1) real production traffic against the specific channel in
question, (2) a direct probe against the vendor's own native endpoint, (3) a probe against a
third-party reseller/gateway, even a clean single-axis one. A synthetic probe at rung 3 that
matches vendor docs is still just a rung-3 result — it does not promote itself to rung 1 by
sounding well-designed. If rung 1 evidence exists (it usually does, in the form of your own
system's logs or request archives), go read it before finalizing a conclusion built entirely on
rung 3.
