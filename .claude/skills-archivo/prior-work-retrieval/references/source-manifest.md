# Source Manifest Contract

The manifest is JSON. Paths are absolute or `~`-prefixed. Nothing is discovered
outside these declarations.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "state_dir": "~/.cache/daymade/prior-work",
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "project-docs",

## Source fields

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique stable ID; used by receipts |
| `carrier` | `code`, `docs`, `skills`, `meeting`, `wechat_archive`, `wechat_live`, `conversation`, or `other` |
| `mode` | `filesystem`, `command`, or `manual` |
| `authority` | `current_implementation`, `project_ssot`, `verified_history`, `raw_history`, `archive`, or `unknown` |
| `required` | Failure/manual gap prevents a globally complete coverage claim |
| `max_results` | Bounded candidates returned from this source |

Filesystem sources require `root` and non-empty `includes`. `excludes` is
optional. Patterns are passed as explicit `rg --glob` arguments; the script does
not invent an include convention.

Command sources require an `argv` array. Only `{query}`, `{limit}`,
`{session_id}`, and `{terms}` are expanded (`{terms}` is optional: it expands to
the space-joined implementation terms — add it once as a single argv element, as
in the example above; a manifest without the slot keeps working unchanged and the
receipt records `terms_passed: false`). The executable is invoked directly, never
through a shell. Supported
result formats are named in the script; an unknown format fails validation.

A command adapter's payload may carry `last_indexed_at` and `complete_frontier`.
They surface on the receipt as readable freshness fields (`freshness`:
`fresh`/`stale`/`unknown` plus `freshness_reason`) — visibility, never a gate:
`status` stays `searched`, so a stale index means "may have missed something",
not "does not exist", and can never block receipt completion.

Manual sources never pretend to be searched. The receipt reports
`manual_required` until an agent completes the named route and records that
evidence outside the automatic run.

## Authority is not a score of truth

Authority tells the reviewer what the source can establish:

- `current_implementation`: what the system currently does.
- `project_ssot`: current intended rule or decision.
- `verified_history`: a historical fact independently checked.
- `raw_history`: what someone said/did at a time; not automatic current truth.
- `archive`: superseded or frozen evidence only.

The reviewer still opens the source. A current implementation can be buggy; a
raw meeting claim can be wrong; a current decision can deliberately supersede a
successful old tactic.
