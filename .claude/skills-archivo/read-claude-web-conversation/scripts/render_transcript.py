"""Render an exported claude.ai conversation JSON into a faithful markdown transcript.

Input: the JSON captured by scripts/export_conversation.js (a /chat/ conversation)
or by the shared-snapshot endpoint (a /share/ link). Both shapes are handled — see
"Two payload shapes" below; always fetch with render_all_tools=true, or the tool
blocks arrive as placeholders and the export is a shell of the conversation.

Usage:
  uv run python render_transcript.py conversation.json -o transcript.md
  uv run python render_transcript.py conversation.json --source-url https://claude.ai/chat/<id>
  uv run python render_transcript.py conversation.json --list-files
  uv run python render_transcript.py conversation.json --extract-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/script.py -o script.py

Modes:
  (default)       full markdown transcript: timestamped speaker headers, upload/
                  output file inventories per message, tool_use blocks rendered
                  per tool type, tool_result folded into Obsidian collapsible
                  callouts (> [!info]-), web_search citations collected into a
                  "Sources cited" list. Obsidian is the default because its Live
                  Preview cannot render HTML <details>.
  --format markdown  use HTML <details> instead of Obsidian callouts.
  --list-files    inventory every downloadable file (uploads / images / sandbox
                  outputs) with the endpoint family each needs.
  --extract-file  reconstruct a sandbox-created file's FINAL content by replaying
                  its create_file block plus every later str_replace in message
                  order — no download needed.
  --allow-lossy   override the fidelity gate (see below). Rarely correct.

Fidelity gate (why this script refuses to run silently):
  Rendering loss here is invisible by construction — a shape the renderer doesn't
  know produces '' and the markdown still looks perfectly well-formed. So nothing is
  written until every unit is accounted for: this unit carried N characters in the
  payload; did the renderer emit anything for it? If content reached the transcript
  as nothing, the export FAILS (exit 2) rather than hand over a plausible-looking
  fraction of the conversation.

  Two properties do the work, and both were learned by getting them wrong:

    * The budget is measured off the RAW payload and never switches on type. A
      per-type measure only looks at the fields that type's renderer happened to know
      about, so the audit inherits the renderer's blind spots and a new field on a
      known type vanishes at "100% retention".
    * The renderer may decide how to PRESENT a field. It may not decide that a field
      it doesn't recognize isn't content — whatever the type-specific branch leaves on
      the floor gets dumped, ugly but visible.

  Audited per tool_result ITEM, per message-level field, and per attachment body —
  not merely per block, because those are the granularities content actually gets lost
  at. Content the PLATFORM emptied (share snapshots) is tracked separately as a
  disclosed gap and never counted as loss.

  Changing the renderer? Run scripts/selftest_fidelity.py. Every case in it is a
  payload that fooled a previous version of this gate.

Two payload shapes:
  /chat/  — `name` holds the title; tool_result.content is a text[] list.
  /share/ — `name` is null (title lives in `snapshot_name`); web_search results
            arrive as `knowledge` items (title/url/text), and every tool call that
            touched the sharer's uploads has its input/content emptied by the
            platform. Those gaps are real and unrecoverable from the link; they are
            disclosed in the transcript header rather than passed off as complete.

#    scored a triumphant 100%. Judge a field by what it IS, never by what the item
#    claims to be.
#
# 2. Keep it SMALL. Over-counting the budget is safe: the renderer just has to emit
#    something for the block, and result_item_text() dumps what it doesn't recognize,
#    so a metadata field counted as content costs nothing. Under-counting is how the
#    gate goes blind. An earlier version padded this list with keys copied in from the
#    file and block layers ('name', 'path', 'file_name', …) that an item may not even
#    have — every one of them a field the audit would refuse to look at. When in
