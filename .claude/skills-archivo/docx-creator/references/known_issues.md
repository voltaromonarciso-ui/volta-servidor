# Known issues

Every entry below comes out of building a real Chinese-contract pipeline on top of
`minimax-skills:minimax-docx` — most of them the hard way, one of them after shipping a broken
document. Format: **symptom → root cause → fix → how to verify the fix**.

Read this before debugging. Most of these fail *silently* — the document generates, the exit
code is 0, and the damage is only visible in Word.

Severity legend: **P0** = ships a broken document. **P1** = costs an hour. **P2** = annoyance.

---

## ISSUE-001 — The CLI cannot express a formal document (P0)

**Symptom.** You build a `--content-json` payload for a contract and there is no way to say
bold, list, table, alignment, font, border, or footer. Output is an undifferentiated wall of
default-styled paragraphs.

**Root cause.** `create --content-json` understands exactly three block types. In
`minimax-docx/scripts/dotnet/MiniMaxAIDocx.Core/Commands/CreateCommand.cs`, `AddContentFromJson`
(line 287) switches over `"heading"`, `"paragraph"`, `"pagebreak"` (lines 301, 309, 313) and
drops everything else on the floor — unknown types are not even warned about, they simply do
not append. The JSON schema is `{type, text, level?}`; there is no field in which bold, list
or table could be encoded.

**Fix.** For anything beyond flat prose, write C# against the OpenXML SDK instead of driving
the CLI. That is what `scripts/Program.cs` is. Keep using the CLI for what it is good at:
`validate` (ISSUE-003), `analyze`, `diff`.

**Verify.** Grep the switch yourself before assuming a block type is supported:
`grep -n 'case "' minimax-docx/scripts/dotnet/MiniMaxAIDocx.Core/Commands/CreateCommand.cs`.
Three cases means three block types.

## ISSUE-002 — `run-script` is documented but does not exist (P1)

**Symptom.** minimax-docx's SKILL.md shows the C# scaffold being executed with
`dotnet run --project minimax-docx/scripts/dotnet/MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli -- run-script task.csx`.
Running it does nothing useful — there is no such command. Falling back to `dotnet-script`
fails too because it is not installed.

**Root cause.** Documentation ahead of implementation. The CLI's command set is what exists in
`minimax-docx/scripts/dotnet/MiniMaxAIDocx.Core/Commands/`: analyze, apply-template, create,
diff, edit-content, fix-order, merge-runs, validate. No script runner among them.

**Fix.** Create your own console project — that is the supported path in practice:

```bash
dotnet new console -o _docxgen
dotnet add _docxgen package DocumentFormat.OpenXml --version 3.2.0
dotnet add _docxgen package Markdig
```

`scripts/mmdocx-gen.csproj` is exactly this, already wired up.

**Verify.** `ls minimax-docx/scripts/dotnet/MiniMaxAIDocx.Core/Commands/` — if there is no
`RunScriptCommand.cs`, the documented invocation is fiction on your installed version.

---

## ISSUE-003 — minimax-docx's CLI will not launch on a .NET 10-only machine (P1)

**Symptom.**

```
You must install or update .NET to run this application.
App: .../MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli/bin/Debug/net8.0/MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli
Framework: 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '8.0.0' (arm64)
The following frameworks were found:
  10.0.5 at [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]
```

The project *builds* fine — this is a launch-time failure, so it looks like the build worked
and the tool is broken.

**Root cause.** Both `MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli.csproj` and `MiniMaxAIDocx.Core.csproj` set
`TargetFramework` to `net8.0`. .NET does not silently roll a framework-dependent app forward
across a **major** version; a machine with only the 10.x shared runtime refuses to host a
net8.0 app.

**Fix.** Do not install an extra runtime. Set the roll-forward policy per invocation:

```bash
DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=Major dotnet run --project <path-to>/MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli -- validate --input out.docx
```

**Verify.** Re-verified live while writing this skill, on a machine with only
`Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.5`: without the env var the launch fails with the message above;
with it, the same command prints `Validation: PASSED`.

Note: this env var is for **minimax-docx's** CLI only. `scripts/mmdocx-gen.csproj` targets the
local SDK's framework and needs no roll-forward.

## ISSUE-004 — Justified text stretches info blocks and signature blocks apart (P0, most expensive)

**Symptom.** In Word, a block like

```
甲方：某某公司
统一社会信用代码：...
法定代表人：...
```

renders with enormous gaps between characters on every line **except the last one**. Body
prose looks perfect. It is the most visually damning failure a formal document can have, and
it does not reproduce in a macOS Quick Look thumbnail (see ISSUE-008).

**Root cause.** `JustificationValues.Both` stretches all lines of a paragraph *except its
final line* — that is what justification means. A markdown info block written as consecutive
lines inside one paragraph (soft breaks) or with trailing double-space (hard breaks) compiles
into **one** Word paragraph containing `<w:br/>` runs. Word therefore has N-1 "non-final"
lines, each of which is short, each of which gets blown out to the full text width.

**Fix.** Alignment must be layered, and the layer is decidable from the AST:

| Content | Alignment |
|---|---|
| H1 title | Center |
| H2+ clause heading | Left |
| Paragraph whose inlines contain a `LineBreakInline` (info block, signature block, address block) | **Left** |
| Ordinary paragraph | Justified (`Both`) |
| Table cells | Left |

In `scripts/Program.cs` the inline walker (`InlineRuns`) returns a `hasBreak` flag and the
block dispatcher — the `case ParagraphBlock p:` arm of `Main`'s switch — picks
`hasBreak ? Left : Both`. (Function names, not line numbers: see `scripts/README.md`'s lookup
table — line numbers here drifted once already when this generator grew, ISSUE-012/013.)

**Verify.** Only through the real chain — LibreOffice-rendered PDF, page PNGs, eyes on the
signature page. `references/verification_protocol.md`. A stretched info block is unmistakable
at 100 DPI.

Reproduced on demand while writing this skill: replacing the decision in the
`case ParagraphBlock p:` arm with an unconditional `JustificationValues.Both` and
regenerating turns `甲方：示例科技有限公司` into `甲 方 ： 示 例 科 技 有 限 公 司` spread
edge to edge, while the **last** line of each block (住所, 联系地址) stays normal — the exact
signature of "justify stretches every line but the last". Restoring the conditional restores
the block. That one-line revert-and-render is the regression test for this issue.

---

## ISSUE-005 — Clause 3's list starts at 4 (P0)

**Symptom.** Each numbered list in the document continues the previous one instead of starting
over: clause 1 has items 1-3, clause 2's list starts at 4.

**Root cause.** All list paragraphs referenced the same numbering instance. In OpenXML a
`NumId` identifies a *counter*, not a *style* — sharing one means sharing its running count.

**Fix.** Allocate a fresh `NumId` per markdown list, and attach a level override that forces a
restart:

```csharp
new NumberingInstance(
    new AbstractNumId { Val = ordered ? 0 : 1 },
    new LevelOverride(new StartOverrideNumberingValue { Val = 1 }) { LevelIndex = 0 }
) { NumberID = numId }
```

Two abstract definitions are enough (one decimal, one bullet); every list gets its own
instance pointing at one of them. Allocation happens in the `case ListBlock lb:` arm of `Main`
(each markdown list bumps `_numId` and records it); emission happens in the
`NumberingDefinitionsPart` setup later in `Main` — see `scripts/README.md`'s lookup table.

**Verify.** The generator prints the number of lists it created; it must equal the number of
lists in the markdown. Then confirm visually — the first item of every list reads `1.`.
Confirmed on a two-clause fixture: the generator reported 3 lists, and the second clause's
list rendered `1.` `2.` rather than continuing from 4.

---

## ISSUE-006 — Numbering part compiles wrong, or opens as a corrupt document (P1)

**Symptom.** Two distinct failures while wiring up ISSUE-005's fix:

1. `error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'Num' could not be found`
2. The .docx builds but Word reports it needs repair, or numbering silently disappears

**Root cause.**

1. Much OpenXML material calls the element `Num` (its XML name is `w:num`). In
   `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` 3.x the generated class is **`NumberingInstance`**.
2. `w:numbering` has a schema-mandated child order: **all** `AbstractNum` elements must
   precede **all** `NumberingInstance` elements. Interleaving them (natural if you append one
   pair per list in a loop) produces schema-invalid XML that some readers reject outright.

**Fix.** Append both `AbstractNum` definitions first, then loop the instances — see the
`NumberingDefinitionsPart` setup in `Main` (`scripts/README.md`'s lookup table). Element-order
rules for other parts are catalogued in minimax-docx's `openxml_element_order.md` reference;
consult it whenever you add a new part — ISSUE-012/013 is what happens when you don't.

**Verify.** `DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=Major dotnet run --project <path-to>/MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli --
validate --input out.docx` — the XSD validator catches ordering violations that Word merely
complains about later. Expect `Validation: PASSED`.

---

## ISSUE-007 — Chinese renders in the wrong font on someone else's machine (P1)

**Symptom.** The document looks right locally and wrong on the recipient's Word — Chinese
characters fall back to a system default, so line lengths, weight and page breaks all shift.

**Root cause.** `RunFonts` has separate slots for Latin (`Ascii`, `HighAnsi`) and East Asian
(`EastAsia`) text. Setting only the Latin slots leaves CJK unspecified; the reader's Word
picks. Font *size* has the same trap: `FontSize` covers the Latin run, `FontSizeComplexScript`
covers complex-script runs, and setting only one produces mixed sizes in bilingual lines.

**Fix.** Always set all three font slots and both size properties:

```csharp
rp.Append(new RunFonts { Ascii = "Times New Roman", HighAnsi = "Times New Roman", EastAsia = "宋体" });
rp.Append(new FontSize { Val = "21" });               // half-points → 10.5pt
rp.Append(new FontSizeComplexScript { Val = "21" });
```

Shipped scheme: 宋体 body / 黑体 headings; 21 half-points body (10.5pt), 36 H1, 28 clause
heading; Chinese bold runs switch family to 黑体 (ISSUE-014); body paragraphs carry a
2-character first-line indent (`FirstLine = "420"` twips, sized for 10.5pt).
See `RunProps` in `scripts/Program.cs` (`scripts/README.md`'s lookup table).

**Verify.** Convert to PDF and inspect embedded fonts (`pdffonts out.pdf`), or read the page
PNGs — a fallback font is visible as a weight and width change against the surrounding text.

---

## ISSUE-008 — `qlmanage` thumbnails are a fake verification (P0 — this one shipped a broken document)

**Symptom.** `qlmanage -t -s 2000 -o /tmp/preview out.docx` produces a clean-looking page.
The document is declared verified. The recipient opens it in Word and the layout is visibly
broken — specifically the ISSUE-004 stretched info blocks, which the thumbnail did not show.

**Root cause.** macOS Quick Look renders .docx with its own lightweight engine, not Word's.
It approximates the layout: it does not reproduce Word's justification stretching, its
numbering-instance behaviour, or its font substitution. It answers "does this file parse",
which was never the question. The question is "does Word lay this out correctly".

**Fix.** Use a renderer with Word-grade layout fidelity. LibreOffice headless is the practical
one:

```bash
soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp/docxcheck out.docx
pdftoppm -png -r 100 /tmp/docxcheck/out.pdf /tmp/docxcheck/page
# Read every page-NN.png
```

**Verify.** The regression test for this rule is ISSUE-004 itself: a document whose
soft-break info block is set to `Both` must look *visibly broken* in the LibreOffice PNG —
confirmed reproducible, see that issue's Verify section. If your verification method shows
that document as fine, your verification method is the qlmanage mistake wearing a different
hat.

Related bans, same reasoning: "exit code 0" is not verification; `python-docx` reading the
text back is not verification (the text was never the problem); "it looks right in the
markdown" is not verification.

---

## ISSUE-009 — LibreOffice install reports success without installing (P1)

**Symptom.** `brew install --cask libreoffice` prints an error like
`App source ... is not there`, purges what it staged, and **still exits 0**. A script that
checks `$?` concludes LibreOffice is installed. The next `soffice` call fails with
command-not-found, and you go looking for a PATH problem that does not exist.

**Root cause.** Cask post-install failure paths that do not propagate a non-zero status.
"Exit code 0" describes the installer's opinion, not the filesystem.

**Fix.** Verify the binary, never the exit code:

```bash
brew reinstall --cask libreoffice
ls -l /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice   # this is the real check
```

Add `/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS` to PATH, or call the binary by full path.

**Verify.** `ls` on the binary path prints a file. Anything else means not installed,
regardless of what the installer said.

---

## ISSUE-010 — First headless LibreOffice run hangs or dies on a profile lock (P2)

**Symptom.** `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf` hangs, or exits complaining the user
profile is in use — typically when the GUI app is open, or when two conversions run
concurrently.

**Root cause.** LibreOffice takes an exclusive lock on its user profile directory. Headless
and GUI instances contend for the same default profile.

**Fix.** Give each headless run a private throwaway profile:

```bash
soffice --headless -env:UserInstallation=file:///tmp/lo-docxcheck \
        --convert-to pdf --outdir /tmp/docxcheck out.docx
```

**Verify.** The PDF appears in the output directory. If it does not, that is a hard failure —
do not proceed to the visual step with a stale PDF from a previous run. Delete the output
directory before each conversion so a missing PDF cannot masquerade as a fresh one.

---

## ISSUE-012 — Word opens the file in "Compatibility Mode" and scatters phantom bullets everywhere (P0 — LibreOffice cannot see this one either)

**Symptom.** Word's title bar shows "兼容性模式" (Compatibility Mode) for a .docx this generator
just produced. On some documents that alone is the only visible symptom; on others, nearly
every paragraph — headings included, paragraphs that were never given `NumberingProperties` —
picks up an extra small square marker in the left margin, as if a phantom bullet list had been
applied document-wide. The Bullets-and-Numbering dialog reports "无" (none) for the affected
paragraph, and the character count of a selected line matches the visible text exactly — the
marker is not part of the paragraph's own run content. It is invisible in a LibreOffice-rendered
PDF: `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf` on the exact same file, `pdftoppm`, and reading every
page shows nothing wrong. It is invisible in `dotnet run ... -- validate` too — that XSD
validator reports `Validation: PASSED` on a file that (see ISSUE-013) contains real schema
violations.

**Root cause.** `Program.cs` never writes a `DocumentSettingsPart` (`word/settings.xml`).
Real Microsoft Word treats a missing compatibility declaration as a signal the document was
authored by an older/incomplete writer and opens it in Compatibility Mode, which substitutes
its own legacy default rendering for whatever the file's own paragraph/run properties say —
this is what surfaces as the unrequested bullet markers. LibreOffice has no equivalent
fallback path and just renders the paragraph properties as given, which is exactly why this
one is invisible to the verification chain this skill already prescribes: **ISSUE-008
identified that a lenient renderer (qlmanage) hides real Word layout bugs and banned it in
favor of LibreOffice — this is the same failure shape one level up. LibreOffice is *also* a
lenient renderer relative to Word for this specific class of defect (missing/malformed
structural parts), and the chain had no step that would ever catch it.**

**Fix.** Add a `DocumentSettingsPart` declaring `compatibilityMode = 15` (Word 2013+):

```csharp
var settingsPart = main.AddNewPart<DocumentSettingsPart>();
settingsPart.Settings = new Settings(
    new Compatibility(
        new CompatibilitySetting {
            Name = new EnumValue<CompatSettingNameValues>(CompatSettingNameValues.CompatibilityMode),
            Uri = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word", Val = "15" }));
```

A `StyleDefinitionsPart` (`styles.xml`) was also missing and has been added alongside it as
standard hygiene — every real-Word-produced .docx carries one — but it was tested in isolation
first and confirmed **not** to be the cause of this symptom; do not skip re-testing in real
Word if you ever touch this again on the assumption "adding styles.xml is the fix." Only the
settings.xml declaration was.

**Verify.** No LibreOffice/XSD-only check can confirm this — that is the entire point of the
issue. Open the actual generated file in **Microsoft Word.app** (`open -a "Microsoft Word"
out.docx`) and read the title bar: no "兼容性模式" suffix, no unrequested markers on any
page. Reproduced and fixed live while writing this skill (2026-08-12): the unpatched generator
produced a file whose title bar read "test-contract — 兼容性模式"; after adding the
`DocumentSettingsPart`, the identical markdown produced a file that opened as plain
"test-contract" with a clean first page and an intact 3-column table on page 2. This is now a
mandatory step — see `references/verification_protocol.md` Step 3a.

---

## ISSUE-013 — The XSD validator says PASSED on a file with real element-order violations (P1 — undermines Step 2's own evidence)

**Symptom.** `dotnet run --project MiniMaxAIDocx.Cli -- validate --input out.docx` prints
`Validation: PASSED`. Running the stricter `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Validation.OpenXmlValidator`
(the OpenXML SDK's own schema validator, same SDK this generator already depends on) against
the identical file reports dozens of real `w:rPr`/`w:pPr`/`w:tblPr`/`w:tblBorders` child-element
ordering violations plus a missing required `w:tblGrid` — see ISSUE-006 for what wrong element
order does structurally; this is the same class of bug, just inside `rPr`/`pPr`/table parts
rather than the `w:numbering` part ISSUE-006 already covers.

**Root cause.** `RunProps` appended `Color` after `FontSize`/`FontSizeComplexScript` and
`Bold`/`BoldComplexScript` after them too (CT_RPr requires `b`, `bCs` before `color`, and
`color` before `sz`/`szCs`); `Para` appended `NumberingProperties` after `Justification`/
`SpacingBetweenLines` (CT_PPrBase requires `numPr` well before `spacing`/`jc`); `BuildTable`
never emitted `w:tblGrid` at all (CT_Tbl requires it immediately after `tblPr`) and ordered
`TableBorders` as top/bottom/left/right instead of the schema's top/left/bottom/right. None of
this is exotic — it is the direct, mechanical consequence of appending OpenXML elements to a
parent in whatever order felt natural in the C# instead of the ECMA-376-mandated sequence for
that specific parent element. minimax-docx's bundled validator evidently does not check this
class of ordering inside `rPr`/`pPr`/`tblPr` — verified by running both validators against the
identical file and getting `PASSED` from one and 59 concrete violations from the other.

**Fix.** Same fix as ISSUE-012's code change (they were repaired together) — reorder the
elements to the ECMA-376 sequence and add the missing `tblGrid`. See the current
`scripts/Program.cs` for the corrected order; the comments at each construction site name the
schema-required sequence so a future edit does not reintroduce this by appending a new
property at the end out of habit.

**Verify.** Run the OpenXML SDK's own validator, not just minimax-docx's CLI:

```csharp
// throwaway console project, DocumentFormat.OpenXml already a dependency
using var doc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(path, false);
var errors = new OpenXmlValidator(FileFormatVersions.Office2013).Validate(doc).ToList();
Console.WriteLine(errors.Count);   // must be 0
```

0 errors confirmed on the same fixed file that also cleared ISSUE-012's real-Word check. This
does not replace Step 2 of the verification protocol (the minimax-docx `validate` command is
still cheap and worth running — it does catch other things, per ISSUE-006), it adds a second,
stricter pass that Step 2 alone does not cover. **Neither validator being green is proof the
document is correct — see ISSUE-012: a schema-valid file can still open in Compatibility Mode.
Only the real-Word check in Step 3a settles that.**

---

## ISSUE-011 — `~$name.docx` beside the target means the recipient has it open (P2)

**Symptom.** You regenerate and overwrite a delivered .docx. The recipient insists nothing
changed.

**Root cause.** A sibling file named `~$<same-name>.docx` is Word's owner lock, written while
a document is open. Its presence means someone has the **old** version open right now.
Overwriting the file on disk does not touch their in-memory copy, and Word may write theirs
back over yours when they save.

**Fix.** Before overwriting, `ls` the target directory for `~$` files. If one exists, tell the
recipient to close the document first, and to reopen it after you deliver.

**Verify.** `ls -a <dir> | grep '^~\$'` returns nothing before you overwrite, and the
recipient confirms a reopen after delivery.

---

## ISSUE-014 — 宋体「加粗」是渲染器合成的假粗体，多笔画汉字糊成一团 (P1)

**Symptom.** A bolded Chinese name or term inside body text renders as a smeared black blob —
most visible on characters with many strokes (three-plus-component names) — in both
LibreOffice preview and Word.

**Root cause.** 宋体 ships no true bold weight. `<w:b/>` on a 宋体 run makes the renderer
*synthesize* bold by algorithmically thickening strokes, and strokes in dense characters merge
into each other. Times New Roman has a real Bold face, so the same flag is fine for Latin —
the failure is specific to the East Asian slot. Chinese typographic convention never bolds
宋体 for emphasis in the first place; emphasis switches family to 黑体.

**Fix.** In `RunProps`, when `bold` is requested and the East Asian font is 宋体, switch the
family instead of relying on the flag:

```csharp
var eastAsia = (bold && font == SONG) ? HEI : font;
rp.Append(new RunFonts { Ascii = WEST, HighAnsi = WEST, EastAsia = eastAsia });
if (bold) { rp.Append(new Bold()); rp.Append(new BoldComplexScript()); }  // Latin still bolds
```

**Verify.** Convert to PDF and read the page PNG: a bolded multi-stroke name must show clean,
separated strokes （黑体's even weight), not a thickened 宋体 with merged counters. Check a
mixed line — Latin bold must remain Times New Roman Bold, visibly distinct from the 黑体 run.


## ISSUE-015 — Body, lists and code share one arbitrary left coordinate

**Symptom.** List markers crowd the margin, wrapped list lines drift, or a code example looks
like an indented prose paragraph even though every measured left coordinate matches.

**Cause.** Body first-line indentation, list marker position, list text position, code panel
edge and panel padding were treated as the same property. Inherited character-unit indents
can also override newly written twip values.

**Fix.** Define roles in the project profile. Body has a first-line indent; lists have a marker
and a text column with a hanging indent; wrapped lines align with the text column. Code has
a panel edge and uniform internal padding, with no prose first-line indent. Clear conflicting
character-unit/direct/style indents before setting the chosen values. Preserve source code
whitespace and literal Markdown markers. Do not make one book's point values universal.

**Verify.** Read a normal-scale page containing body + short and wrapped lists + a multiline
code example. Compare the relationships above, not equality of all left coordinates.

## ISSUE-016 — Disabled numbering or typed ordinals become automatic lists

**Symptom.** A paragraph runs off-page, a typed “1）” gains an extra bullet, or two-digit items
and continuation lines no longer align.

**Cause.** `numId=0` was treated as a real list, a producer-specific `ilvl=255` sentinel was
multiplied as nesting depth, or a typed ordinal and automatic numbering were both emitted.

**Fix.** Resolve the effective numbering first. `numId=0` removes numbering; retain that
suppression if a style would otherwise reintroduce it. A sentinel is not a depth: unknown
levels must be diagnosed, not converted to an enormous indent. Distinguish literal ordinals
from automatic numbering; do not erase meaningful text. Use a tab stop and sufficient label
width for typed ordinals when normalizing their separator whitespace. Preserve intentional
numbering continuations and semantic code lists.

**Verify.** Exercise disabled numbering with an inherited list style, automatic bullet and
decimal lists, and typed 1）/10） items wrapping to a second line. Ensure one marker per item
and one continuation column. The Microsoft contract for the disabling value is in
[NumberingId](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/documentformat.openxml.wordprocessing.numberingid?view=openxml-3.0.1).

## ISSUE-017 — Code punctuation changes shape despite intact extracted text

**Symptom.** URLs, arrows or ellipses look wrong while text comparison passes.

**Cause.** A programming font substitutes ligatures; the renderer may ignore the document's
ligature-disable setting. Theme/direct font overrides or missing CJK glyphs cause a second
class of fallback defects.

**Fix.** Verify installed fonts and the exported PDF's actual faces. When the target renderer
ignores ligature controls, use a verified non-ligature Latin mono face and an appropriate CJK
face. Inspect mixed-font lines; do not assume one font file covers every symbol.

**Verify.** Render literal `https://example.invalid`, `>>`, `...`, `#`, Chinese, and symbols
used by the document. Compare visible glyphs as well as extracted text.

## ISSUE-018 — Images are present in the file but clipped to a text-height strip

**Symptom.** Image relationships and counts match, but the PDF shows only a narrow strip or
a blank-looking page region.

**Cause.** A body-wide exact line height was also applied to inline-image paragraphs.

**Fix.** Give image paragraphs automatic/minimum line height, bound the image dimensions to
the available page area, and keep the caption attached. Do not apply exact body line height
to every paragraph.

**Verify.** Inspect the complete visible figure and its caption in the final PDF, including
a tall figure and a figure beside a page break. An image-object count alone cannot pass it.
