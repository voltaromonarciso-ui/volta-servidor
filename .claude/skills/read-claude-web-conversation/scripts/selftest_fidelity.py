"""Regression suite for the fidelity gate. Run it after ANY change to render_transcript.py.

    uv run python scripts/selftest_fidelity.py

Why this file exists, bluntly: the gate has already been wrong twice, and both times
it was wrong in the same direction — reporting **100% retention** on payloads it had
lost almost all of. A gate that fails silently is worse than no gate, because it
launders a broken export into a certified one. Prose cannot defend against that; only
a payload that provably breaks it can.

Each case below is a shape that DID slip through a previous version. Keep them, and
add one whenever a new shape gets past the gate — the cost of a case is a dozen lines,
and the cost of skipping it is a transcript that lies.
