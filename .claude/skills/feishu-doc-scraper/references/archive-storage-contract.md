# Archive Storage Contract

Use this contract after faithful extraction and before filing the result into a knowledge base. It prevents a common category error: treating a successful download as proof that a raw binary belongs in Git.

## Artifact properties

For each artifact record:

1. `storage` states the durable source of record: `git`, `source`, or `oss`.
2. `locator` says how to retrieve that durable object.
3. `cache_path` is optional and never changes the source of record. A cache may disappear on another machine without making the archive incomplete.

Git is the default only for searchable structured material: Markdown, CSV, JSON, YAML, text, XML, and source HTML. The artifact role, path, and MIME must also agree with that structured format. A structured path normally has exactly one extension; the only multi-extension exception is a terminal version suffix such as `report-v2.0.md`, and the filename before that version may not contain another dot. This rejects `clip.mp4.md`, `photo.heic.md`, and `clip.mp4-v2.0.md` without pretending that a filename replaces byte/MIME verification. MP4, Office files, PDFs, and raster/vector images are raw binaries and must not use `storage: git`.

An LFS-compatible pointer does not identify the durable backend. If the host archive
uses pointers with an authorized OSS transfer adapter, declare the binary as
`storage: oss` with its OSS locator; the pointer and local checkout are retrieval
mechanisms. Follow the host's storage SOP for upload and fresh-clone readback.

`mime` records the capture-time detector result for the local artifact bytes. Markdown may therefore be `text/markdown`, `text/plain`, or `text/html` when faithful Markdown contains enough embedded HTML for the detector to classify it as HTML; the artifact role and path still remain structured Markdown.

## Source-of-record examples

Feishu original with an optional local cache:

```json
{
  "role": "embedded_media_original",
  "storage": "source",
  "locator": {
    "system": "feishu",
    "source_url": "https://example.feishu.cn/wiki/<node-token>",
    "token": "<file-token>"
  },
  "cache_path": "<local-cache-path>/clip.mp4",
  "bytes": 123456,
  "sha256": "<sha256>",
  "mime": "video/mp4"
}
```

Structured derivative in Git:

```json
{
  "role": "sheet_csv",
  "storage": "git",
  "path": "sources/<sheet-id>.csv",
  "bytes": 4321,
  "sha256": "<sha256>",
  "mime": "text/csv"
}
```

Independent object-storage copy:

```json
{
  "role": "owner_exported_docx",
  "storage": "oss",
  "locator": {
    "system": "oss",
    "uri": "oss://<bucket>/<content-addressed-key>"
  },
  "cache_path": "<local-cache-path>/owner-export.docx",
  "bytes": 98765,
  "sha256": "<sha256>",
  "mime": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
}
```

## Decision rule

- Use `source` when Feishu or Lark still exposes the original through a stable document/file/whiteboard/minutes locator. A temporary CDN URL or local path is not stable; store the source token and parent source instead. Locator fields are provider-specific allowlists, so an unrelated local `path` cannot hide beside otherwise valid fields.
- Use `oss` when independent retention is a real requirement or the original platform locator is not a reliable future retrieval path. Uploading changes external state, so it must be authorized and independently read back.
- Use `git` for the structured layer that makes the archive searchable, diffable, and maintainable. Git is not a generic blob store here, and Git LFS does not change that boundary.

If an artifact is both on Feishu and OSS, choose the intended authority as `storage` and record the other under `replicas`. Each replica is exactly `{storage, locator}`; its locator is validated by the same provider allowlist as the primary. Do not add `path`, `cache_path`, or a second authority field inside a replica.

```json
{
  "storage": "source",
  "locator": {
    "system": "feishu",
    "source_url": "https://example.feishu.cn/wiki/<node-token>",
    "token": "<file-token>"
  },
  "replicas": [
    {
      "storage": "oss",
      "locator": {"system": "oss", "uri": "oss://<bucket>/<key>"}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation

Run from the skill directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_archive_storage.py <artifact-manifest.json>
```

The validator fails when:

- a raw binary is declared `storage: git`;
- a Git artifact's role, suffix, and declared MIME do not describe the same structured format;
- a structured Git path hides an unapproved intermediate extension;
- an external artifact has no stable locator;
- a locator does not satisfy its source-system contract (Feishu URL + token, WeChat chat + message ID, or OSS URI);
- a primary entry or replica carries fields outside its storage-specific allowlist;
- a Git artifact has no `path`;
- an external artifact uses `path` instead of `cache_path`, which would make a working copy look authoritative;
- `storage` is absent or unknown.

The validator does not upload, delete, or move anything. Byte/hash verification remains the host archive workflow's responsibility because only it knows whether a cache is expected to exist on that machine.
