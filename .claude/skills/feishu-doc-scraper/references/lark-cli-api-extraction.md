# lark-cli API Extraction (Path A — primary)

The primary, highest-fidelity way to turn a Feishu/Lark source into Markdown. Everything here was verified end-to-end on a real multi-document collection import (lark-cli 1.0.27 and 1.0.32, 2026-05; re-verified on 1.0.55, 2026-06 — which is where the docs-body and sheet field paths below changed, see Steps 3–4).

## Why API over browser

On real collection work the lark-cli path did the entire job and the browser path was never needed, because the API path:

1. Recurses a hub's reference graph programmatically — a browser cannot "follow" `<mention-doc>` references mechanically.
2. Resolves permission boundaries from exact error codes (`131006`, `99991679`) instead of guessing from a rendered page.
3. Streams the body to disk via `jq`/`cat` so the document text **never passes through the model** (paraphrasing is undetectable later — the core fidelity argument).
4. Does not depend on a browser extension being connected (the in-browser surface frequently fails to connect; an anonymous debugging Chrome cannot read login-walled content anyway).

## Step 0: proxy and auth preflight

```bash
export LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1
lark-cli --version          # confirm ≥ 1.0.32 (2026-05); older works but lacks fixes
lark-cli auth status        # must be valid for the target tenant
```

`LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1` is mandatory for `*.feishu.cn` (mainland, direct-connect). Without it, lark-cli prints:

```
[lark-cli] [WARN] proxy detected: https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1082 — requests
(including credentials) will transit through this proxy. Set LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1 to disable proxy.
```

That warning is the signal — credentials would transit the proxy and Feishu's domestic DNS would be hijacked. This is host-specific and does not conflict with rules that force `claude.ai`/`anthropic.com` through a proxy; Feishu is a different, direct host.

## Step 1: classify the URL

| URL shape | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `…/wiki/<node_token>` | wiki node (a pointer, **not** a doc) | Step 2 then Step 3 |
| `…/docx/<doc_token>` | doc, already a doc token | Step 3 directly |
| `…/sheets/<sp_token>` | spreadsheet | Step 4 |
| `…/minutes/<minute_token>` | Minutes / 妙记 | see feishu-minutes-transcript.md |
| `…/base/<token>`, `…/file/<token>` | Bitable / file attachment | see reference-graph dispatch (Step 5) |
| `https://<anything>.feishu.cn/docx/…` or `https://my.feishu.cn/docx/…` | cross-tenant / personal space | Step 6 (same fetch, permission is per-doc) |

## Step 2: resolve wiki node → doc token

A wiki `node_token` is a navigation pointer; fetching it as a doc fails. Resolve it:

```bash
lark-cli wiki spaces get_node --params '{"token":"<node_token>"}'
```

Returns `{"code":0,"data":{"node":{"node_token":"…","obj_token":"<DOC_TOKEN>","obj_type":"docx","node_type":"origin","has_child":false,…}}}`.

- Use `.data.node.obj_token` + `.data.node.obj_type` for Step 3.
- `has_child:false` on the entry node does **not** mean "no content" — a collection hub is typically a single docx whose *body* references many other docs (Step 5), not a multi-node wiki tree.
- `code 131006 … node permission denied` → this node is permission-walled; stop and go to Path B (docx-export-to-markdown.md). Do not try to bypass it.

## Step 3: fetch the body programmatically

**Comments are a parallel source, not part of the body field.** For each document
actually opened, run [comment capture](comments-and-feedback.md) and read all
selected threads before summarizing. Preserve its JSON and Markdown companion,
add a visible discussion link beside the body, and report its scope and gaps.
The same step applies to documents reached recursively in Step 5.

The body field moved between lark-cli versions, so probe both instead of hard-coding one — this keeps working whichever version is installed:

```bash
lark-cli docs +fetch --doc <obj_token> --format json > /tmp/fetch.json 2> /tmp/fetch.err
# ≤1.0.32: clean Markdown in .data.markdown.
# 1.0.55+: body moved to .data.document.content as HTML (.data.markdown is
# null — verified null in 11/11 real documents checked as of 2026-08-17,
# including 3/3 fresh fetches on the currently-installed 1.0.80; whether the
# .data.markdown branch is still reachable on any current build was not
# confirmed).
if jq -e -r '.data.markdown // empty' /tmp/fetch.json > "<sanitized-title>.md" && [ -s "<sanitized-title>.md" ]; then
  : # got clean Markdown directly
else
  jq -r '.data.document.content' /tmp/fetch.json > "<sanitized-title>.html"
  pandoc -f html -t gfm "<sanitized-title>.html" > "<sanitized-title>.md"
fi
```

- On 1.0.55+ the HTML in `.data.document.content` carries Feishu structure as `<h1>/<table>/<cite doc-id=…>` tags; `pandoc -f html -t gfm` renders headings and ordinary tables faithfully. ⚠️ **But `<cite>` (mention-doc) and `<whiteboard token=…>` do NOT survive — pandoc drops them with zero trace** (verified 2026-08-16/17 against real documents; for `<cite>` not even the bare title text survives, since the title lives in a `title="…"` attribute and the tag body is empty). Because of this, **Step 5's extractor and leaf-gate must run against the saved `<sanitized-title>.html`, never against the pandoc-converted `.md`**, whenever this branch was taken — see Step 5 below. `--format markdown` is **not** a valid value (lark-cli warns and falls back to json).
- **Keep stdout/stderr separate.** `stderr` may carry `[deprecated] docs +fetch with v1 API is deprecated` — harmless. Doing `2>/dev/null | jq` in one pipe produced a spurious `Exit code 5`; redirect to files and inspect instead.
- **Never** reconstruct the body by reading and retyping it — `jq`/`pandoc` it to disk. pandoc only re-renders HTML structure (it does not rewrite prose), so the fidelity guarantee that makes Path A safer than any browser/LLM path still holds.
- `--format json` is required so you parse one field deterministically.

## Step 4: spreadsheets

A `<sheet token="<SP>_<SID>"/>` tag (or a `…/sheets/<SP>` URL) carries the spreadsheet token and sheet id joined by `_`. A spreadsheet usually has **multiple tabs** — list them all and pull each, don't assume one:

```bash
# list every tab. Note the nesting: 1.0.55 returns .data.sheets.sheets[] (two levels);
# older builds returned .data.sheets[]. The // keeps it version-robust.
lark-cli sheets +info --spreadsheet-token <SP> \
  --jq '(.data.sheets.sheets // .data.sheets)[]? | {sheet_id, title}'

# read one tab. ⚠️ `--format csv` does NOT emit CSV for cells-get (verified 1.0.55) —
# it returns a JSON cell grid (.data.ranges[].cells[][].value) regardless. Convert with jq:
lark-cli sheets +cells-get --spreadsheet-token <SP> --sheet-id <SID> --range A1:AZ800 \
  | jq -r '.data.ranges[0].cells[] | map(.value // "" | tostring) | @csv' > "<tab-title>.csv"
```

- The cell grid carries border/style objects too; `.value` is the text, empty cells are `{}` → `.value // ""`. `tostring` guards numeric cells.
- A tab `title` can contain newlines (`\n`); strip them (`tr -d '\n\r'`) before using it as a filename.
- **Check `.data.has_more`** — cells-get caps one response at ~4000–6000 cells (~200 rows); if `has_more:true` the grid was truncated — page with a smaller range / offset. `.data.ranges[0].actual_range` reports what you actually got.
- Older builds exposed this as `sheets +read … --value-render-option ToString --jq '.data.valueRange.values'` (a 2-D array). If `+cells-get` is absent on your version, fall back to `+read`.
- **Date cells return serial numbers** (e.g. `45000`), not date strings — Excel-style epoch, `date(1899,12,30) + N days`. Convert before filtering by date.

### Step 4b: cell attachments (uploaded files inside sheet cells)

Business sheets often carry uploaded files (video/PDF/image) as **cell attachments**. Two traps, both verified on 1.0.65 (2026-07-09):

1. **`+cells-get` flattens attachments to their filename text** — the fileToken is unrecoverable from it. To get tokens, hit the raw v2 values API, where an attachment cell is a segment array:

```bash
lark-cli api GET "/open-apis/sheets/v2/spreadsheets/<SP>/values/<SID>!D2:D50"
# attachment segment: {"type":"attachment","fileToken":"...","text":"<filename>","size":N,"mimeType":"video/mp4"}
```

2. **Downloading: `drive +download` returns HTTP 403 for these tokens** (that command wraps the *files* API; sheet attachments are *media* resources). Use the media temp-URL endpoint — and pass `file_tokens` as a **JSON array**; a comma-joined string silently returns an empty result:

```bash
lark-cli api GET "/open-apis/drive/v1/medias/batch_get_tmp_download_url" \
  --params '{"file_tokens":["TOKEN1","TOKEN2"]}'
# → per-token tmp_download_url (valid ~24h) → curl each to disk
# Feishu CDN is a domestic (CN) service: bypass any local HTTP proxy when curling.
```

Also note `drive +download --output` only accepts a **relative path** under the CWD (a safety constraint) — `cd` to the destination first.

Both calls above were verified with the default identity; if they return a permission error on a user-owned spreadsheet, append `--as user` (the raw-API pattern used elsewhere in this file).

The downloaded file is a working cache, not the default durable archive. Preserve the stable `fileToken`, parent spreadsheet/sheet locator, observed filename/size/MIME, and downloaded SHA-256 in the artifact manifest. For a knowledge base, keep the CSV/JSON and manifest in Git; keep the raw attachment authoritative on Feishu unless an explicitly authorized OSS replica is needed. The storage schema and validator are in `archive-storage-contract.md`.

## Step 5: the reference-graph recursion (collections/hubs)

A hub is the root of a reference graph. Treat it as BFS/DFS over references until every branch reaches a leaf (a doc with no further references).

**Enumerate references with the bundled extractor** (a missed reference is a missing document — the single biggest hub-scraping failure; do not hand-roll `grep` and forget the `my.feishu.cn` personal-space pattern, which is exactly what happened before this script existed):

```bash
python3 scripts/feishu_extract_refs.py <fetched-body>.html
# prefer the raw HTML saved in Step 3; fall back to <fetched-body>.md only if
# no .html was ever saved (the .data.markdown branch)
# → JSON array of {type, ref, title, dispatch}
```

The references it recognizes (the full rich-media inventory): `<mention-doc token type>`, `<sheet token>`, `<lark-table><lark-tr><lark-td>` (inline tables — render in place, not a reference), `<image token>`, `<whiteboard token>` (inline diagram block — export+Read, NOT a followable reference, see below), `<view><file>`, cross-tenant `https://<tenant>.feishu.cn/(docx|wiki|sheets|base|file)/<token>`, personal-space `https://my.feishu.cn/docx/<token>`, Minutes `https://<tenant>.feishu.cn/minutes/<token>`, Tencent-Meeting `https://meeting.tencent.com/crm/<id>`. ⚠️ The `<mention-doc>`/`<image>`/`<lark-table>` shapes above are this doc's shorthand names for the reference *types*, not their literal raw-HTML syntax — the real, verified tag shapes (`<cite doc-id=…>`, `<img src=…>`, plain `<table>`) are documented with evidence in `scripts/feishu_extract_refs.py`'s regex comments; trust those over these shorthand names when hand-verifying a residual tag.

**Dispatch table:**

| Reference type | Handler |
|---|---|
| `mention-doc` type `docx` / cross-tenant `/docx/` / `my.feishu.cn/docx/` | Step 3 `docs +fetch` |
| `mention-doc` / URL `/wiki/` | Step 2 then Step 3 |
| `sheet` / `/sheets/` | Step 4 |
| `/minutes/` URL | feishu-minutes-transcript.md (native transcript API) |
| `meeting.tencent.com/crm/` | Tencent Meeting tooling (outside this skill — its native transcript API; never download+re-ASR) |
| `<lark-table>` | render inline to a Markdown table (pandas `read_html` handles colspan/rowspan); it is content, not a link |
| `<image token>` | register the token; lark-cli cannot download it (see permission-and-failure-boundaries.md) |
| `<whiteboard token>` | NOT recursed — export a preview image (`lark-cli whiteboard +export --whiteboard-token <token> --output-type preview --output <path>.jpg --overwrite`) and Read it; keep the JPEG as a cache by default, with the whiteboard token as the stable source locator; see SKILL.md Path A step 4 and `archive-storage-contract.md` |
| `<view><file>` | attachment — record token + filename; treat like an image gap unless separately retrievable |

**Recursion loop:** fetch root → extract refs → for each new ref, dispatch and fetch → run the extractor on each newly fetched body → repeat until no new tokens appear. A child doc can itself embed another reference (e.g. a summary doc that embeds a third Minutes link); the loop must re-scan every newly fetched file, not only the root.

**Leaf / completion gate** — before declaring the collection done, no rich-media reference may remain unresolved anywhere:

```bash
grep -rlE '<(lark-table|lark-tr|sheet token=|mention-doc|cite doc-id=|whiteboard token=|view type=)' . \
  && echo "UNRESOLVED — keep recursing" || echo "clean"
```

⚠️ **On each document's saved `.html`, "empty" is not a literal stop condition.** Each `<sanitized-title>.html` (Step 3's per-document naming — never a literal shared `source.html` across a hub's multiple fetches, or the second fetch silently destroys the first) is an immutable raw capture of that one document — nothing in this skill rewrites a document's own file in place — so a hub doc that genuinely references N children or M diagrams keeps showing N+M matches forever in its own file, even after every one is correctly handled; chasing this grep to a literal zero across the whole directory will never terminate for a real hub. Treat each match as a worklist item: a `mention-doc`/`cite doc-id=`/`sheet` hit is resolved once the referenced child has actually been fetched and saved (as its own distinct file); a `whiteboard` hit is resolved once its preview `.jpg` was exported and Read (dispatch-table row above) — it is not a missing document to fetch, don't treat it as one. This grep still recurses over every file already on disk, so it naturally covers every document's raw `.html` saved in Step 3 alongside its pandoc-converted `.md` — no extra step needed there. (On the `.data.markdown` branch, where the fetched body is the deliverable Markdown itself, a literal empty result remains the simpler signal.)

## Step 6: cross-tenant and personal-space sources

`https://<other-tenant>.feishu.cn/docx/…` and `https://my.feishu.cn/docx/…` (personal space) use the **same** `docs +fetch` — Feishu permission is per-document, not per-domain. A reference living in another tenant or someone's personal space is often still readable with the current token. Do not skip a reference just because its host differs; try the fetch and let the error code (`131006` / `0`) decide.

**Which profile to use across tenants.** lark-cli auths per-app, and the same person often has several profiles (a *personal-edition* app and an *enterprise-edition* app). For documents scattered across — or shared into — *several different tenants*, the document **owner's personal-edition profile** tends to reach all of them, because the owner holds a personal grant on each. An **enterprise-edition** app frequently fails these with `app_scope_not_applied` (`99991672` — the app never requested `wiki:wiki` / `wiki:node:read` scopes in its developer console, and a per-user OAuth cannot add an app-level scope). So when one profile 403s on a cross-tenant link, retry with the owner's personal profile **before** concluding it's permission-walled.

## Step 7: frontmatter and provenance

Each produced file should carry minimal frontmatter so the extraction is auditable and the host PKM can file it (this skill stops at producing it, not filing it):

```yaml
---
title: <document title>
source: <original feishu URL or token>
source_type: docx | wiki | sheet | minutes
extracted: <YYYY-MM-DD>
post_process: <one line if any non-trivial transform was applied; omit if pure jq passthrough>
---
```

`post_process` matters when text was reshaped (e.g. a sheet rendered to a table, or Path B's heading restoration) — it tells a future reader the body is not a byte-for-byte API passthrough.

## Command troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `docs +fetch` "Exit code 5" but data looks present | `2>/dev/null` swallowed stderr while `jq` failed on mixed stream | Redirect stdout/stderr to separate files; parse the file |
| `wiki spaces get_node` → `code 131006` | No read permission on that node | Path B (owner exports docx); do not bypass |
| `docs +fetch` / `get_node` → `TLS handshake timeout` on `open.feishu.cn` (often the first call) | transient mainland-network flake, not auth | just retry — it succeeds on the 2nd/3rd attempt; don't re-auth or switch profiles over it |
| `get_node` / `docs +fetch` → `99991672 app_scope_not_applied` | enterprise-edition app lacks `wiki:*` scope | switch to the owner's personal-edition profile (Step 6); a per-user re-login can't add an app scope |
| `api …/transcript` → `code 99991679` | Missing scope | feishu-minutes-transcript.md (device-flow scope grant) |
| lark-cli reports `API returned an empty JSON response body` | lark-cli mis-renders a binary/error HTTP response | Real status is hidden — see permission-and-failure-boundaries.md; do not trust "empty JSON" literally |
| Need an API lark-cli does not wrap | — | `lark-cli api <METHOD> <path> --params '{…}' --as user`; find the spec via `open.feishu.cn/llms-docs/zh-CN/llms-<module>.txt` (the `/document/server-docs/` pages are flaky in WebFetch) |

## What a clean run looks like

Single doc:

```
$ export LARK_CLI_NO_PROXY=1
$ lark-cli wiki spaces get_node --params '{"token":"<node_token>"}'
{"code":0,"data":{"node":{"obj_token":"<DOC>","obj_type":"docx","has_child":false,...}}}
$ lark-cli docs +fetch --doc <DOC> --format json > /tmp/f.json 2> /tmp/f.err
$ jq -r '.data.markdown' /tmp/f.json | wc -c
   6166
$ LC_ALL=C grep -rl $'\xef\xbf\xbd' . ; echo "ffd_count=$?"
ffd_count=1          # 1 = grep found nothing = clean
```

Collection: the same, then N rounds of `feishu_extract_refs.py` → dispatch → fetch, ending with the residual-tag grep printing `clean`.
