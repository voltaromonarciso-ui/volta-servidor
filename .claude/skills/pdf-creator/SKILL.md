# PDF Creator

Create professional PDF documents from markdown with Chinese font support and theme system.

For an existing `.docx` source, use `docx-creator/references/word-to-pdf.md` instead.
Choose by the authoritative input as well as the output suffix.

## Quick Start

Every `scripts/…` path below is **relative to this skill's own directory** — run the commands from there, or substitute the absolute path. Running them from the directory holding your markdown fails with `Failed to spawn: 'scripts/md_to_pdf.py'`. Omitting the output path is allowed and derives it from the input's basename (`input.md` → `input.pdf`, in the input's directory).

```bash
# Default theme (formal: Songti SC + black/grey, A4 print)
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/md_to_pdf.py input.md output.pdf

# Warm theme (training: PingFang SC + terra cotta)
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/md_to_pdf.py input.md --theme warm-terra

# Mobile theme (narrow page, large font — for phone reading / WeChat sharing)
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/md_to_pdf.py input.md --theme mobile

# Batch convert all markdown files with a specific theme
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/batch_convert.py *.md --theme warm-terra --no-preview

# No weasyprint? Use Chrome backend (auto-detected if weasyprint unavailable)
python scripts/md_to_pdf.py input.md --theme warm-terra --backend chrome

# List available themes
python scripts/md_to_pdf.py --list-themes dummy.md
```

## Themes

Stored in `themes/*.css`. Each theme is a standalone CSS file.

| Theme | Page Size | Font | Color | Best for |
|-------|-----------|------|-------|----------|
| `default` | A4 | Songti SC + Heiti SC | Black/grey | Legal docs, contracts, formal reports |
| `cjk-auto` | A4 | Songti SC + Heiti SC | Black/grey | Tables with uneven column content (course schedules, itemized lists) |
| `warm-terra` | A4 | PingFang SC | Terra cotta (#d97756) + warm neutrals | Course outlines, training materials, workshops |
| `warm-terra-menu` | A4 | PingFang SC | Terra cotta (#d97756) + warm neutrals | warm-terra variant hardened for module menus/lists: 2-column long-text tables wrap without first-column overflow + Menlo unicode-range keeps CJK inline-code from rendering blank in Preview/Adobe |
| `mobile` | 148mm × 210mm | PingFang SC | Terra cotta + warm neutrals | Phone reading, WeChat sharing, on-the-go reference |

To create a new theme: copy `themes/default.css`, modify, save as `themes/your-theme.css`.

## Print vs Mobile: Choose the Right Theme

| Scenario | Recommended Theme | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Print on A4 paper, handouts, contracts | `default` | Standard page size, formal typography |
| Training materials, course outlines | `warm-terra` | Warm accent color, readable for workshop contexts |
| Send via WeChat, read on phone | `mobile` | Narrow page (148mm), 15px font, 1.9 line-height — comfortable on small screens |
| Both print AND mobile needed | Run twice with different themes | The skill is fast; generate both versions |

**Decision rule:** If the user does not specify, default to `warm-terra` for training/course content and `default` for formal documents — but pick `cjk-auto` over `default` when the document's tables have uneven column content (schedules, itemized lists), which is what that theme's `table-layout: auto` exists for. Ask "是否需要手机版？" only when the output channel is unclear.

## Backends

The script auto-detects the best available backend from **content × theme** — the theme half matters because the reason CJK ever needed Chrome is a property of the theme's font stack, not of the text being Chinese:

- **CJK + a Songti/Heiti theme** (`default`, `cjk-auto`) → **weasyprint**. These themes embed CID TrueType, which every reader renders, so Chrome buys nothing and costs the clip described below.
- **CJK + a PingFang theme** (`warm-terra`, `mobile`, `warm-terra-menu`, and any theme not on the safe list) → **Chrome**. weasyprint subset-embeds PingFang SC as CID Type 0C OpenType, which macOS Preview / Adobe Reader fail to render — garbled text on the recipient's device even though Chrome's own PDF viewer looks fine.
- **Non-CJK content** → **weasyprint** (faster, no browser startup).

Routing is pinned by `scripts/tests/test_backend_routing.py`. A theme you add yourself is treated as PingFang-class until you add it to `_WEASYPRINT_SAFE_CJK_THEMES` in `md_to_pdf.py` — do that only after confirming its CJK faces are CID TrueType.

| Backend | Install | Pros | Cons |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| `weasyprint` | `pip install weasyprint` | Precise CSS rendering, no browser needed, does not clip overflow | Subsets PingFang SC as CID Type 0C — unreadable in Preview/Adobe |
| `chrome` | Google Chrome installed | Zero Python deps, renders PingFang correctly | **Clips anything past the @page box** (see below) |

Override with `--backend chrome` or `--backend weasyprint`; an explicit flag always wins over auto-detection.

**The theme does not tell you which backend ran.** When weasyprint is not importable, a `default` / `cjk-auto` render falls back to Chrome — with a warning on stderr, and exit 0. Read the `backend=` field of the `Generated:` line to find out which one you got; that field, not the theme name, is what decides whether the Chrome-only step below applies.

### Chrome clips, it does not merely overflow

Chrome wraps each page in a `re W* n` clip path at the `@page` content box. Content past that box is still in the PDF's object layer but is **never painted**. Measured on A4 with `margin: 2.5cm 2cm 2cm 2cm`: the clip path ends at **538.90pt**, while the table's right border sits at **545.18pt** — so the border is silently amputated.

**This is not a "wide table" problem — under `default` and `cjk-auto` it is every table.** Those themes set `table { table-layout: fixed; width: 100% }`, so a two-column table spans the same full content width as a ten-column one and lands its right border at the same 545.18pt. Measured: a trivial `| 周一 | 周二 |` table clips identically to a six-column fee schedule. Content width is irrelevant; the theme's own `width: 100%` plus cell padding is what crosses the line.

The overflow itself is **by design**: the CJK typography layer sets `overflow-wrap: normal` precisely so content overflows rather than breaking mid-token (see "CJK Typography" below). That trade-off is safe under weasyprint and destructive under Chrome.

**The reason this survived repeated delivery is not that the preview lies — it is that the symptom looks deliberate.** The last column's text is complete and correctly spaced; only a hairline border is gone, which reads as a styling choice. Meanwhile the visual checklist below primes you to look for *text cut off*, which is exactly what does not happen here.

Rasterisers do honour the clip, so the preview PNGs this script already generates (`pdftoppm` at 130 dpi) do show the defect, as does a 400 dpi render — at 400 dpi, zero ink across the 25 pixel columns straddling the expected border. What does **not** show it is any check that reads coordinates instead of pixels — `pdfplumber` still reports a rect at 545.18pt, because the object is genuinely there.

Rather than rely on noticing a missing hairline, run the check. **It takes two forms, and for a Chrome-rendered PDF only the second one is a verdict.**

```bash
# Form 1 — one file. Compares ink against the PDF's own object layer.
uv run --with pdfplumber --with pillow --with numpy scripts/check_table_borders.py out.pdf
```

Form 1 takes each detected table's column boundaries, counts the ones that actually have ink in a `pdftoppm` raster, and exits non-zero naming any boundary present in the PDF but absent on paper. It reports how many tables it measured, and says `NOTHING CHECKED` rather than `PASS` when it found none — a document whose table it could not detect has not been cleared, it has been skipped.

The boundaries come from the cell grid rather than from raw vertical edges, because a `<hr>`'s end-caps and an inline `<code>` span's background look exactly like column rules to an edge-based reader. Measured on 49 WeasyPrint-produced PDFs from a real knowledge base, 46 of which had geometry the edge-based version examined: it failed 34 of those 46. Residual limit: on PDFs from other tools, `pdfplumber` sometimes assembles decoration into a table that was never there, and the check will report rules for it. Treat a failure on a PDF this skill did not produce as a prompt to look, not a verdict.

**It cannot clear a Chrome render on its own, because the clip destroys evidence two different ways.** Chrome keeps geometry that *straddles* the clip — form 1 catches that, since the rule is promised and unpainted — but drops geometry lying *entirely* outside it, and a rule that was never written into the object layer is never looked for. Measured: a table styled with vertical rules and no cell fills prints `5/5 promised rules painted — PASS` while its right border is genuinely gone. The bundled themes escape that only by accident; their cell background fills straddle the clip and leave an edge at the border's position for form 1 to find.

So when the theme routes to Chrome and the document has tables, render the same source with the other backend and compare:

```bash
# Form 2 — render a reference with the other backend, then compare.
# Use the SAME --theme as the deliverable; only the backend differs.
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/md_to_pdf.py doc.md /tmp/ref.pdf \
  --theme warm-terra --backend weasyprint --no-preview
uv run --with pdfplumber --with pillow --with numpy \
  scripts/check_table_borders.py out.pdf --reference /tmp/ref.pdf
```

Exit codes: `0` passed, `1` at least one check did not pass, `2` the check could not run, `3` no table was detected so nothing was measured. **`3` is not a pass**: if the document does have a table, its style drew no rules `pdfplumber` could find, so this check cannot speak for it — fall back to reading the raster at the table's right edge yourself, and say in your handoff that the gate did not run. `pdfplumber` prints `Could not get FontBBox from font descriptor` for subset CJK fonts on the way; that is parser noise, not a finding.

The reference is a measuring stick, never a deliverable — it may well have the CID Type 0C problem that sent this theme to Chrome in the first place, which does not affect its geometry.

**Both files are ink-checked, and the rule counts are compared in both directions**, so the order you pass them in cannot decide whether the damaged file gets examined. That matters more than it sounds: for a border that Chrome *clipped* rather than *dropped*, the two renders have the SAME rule count — the geometry is still there, merely unpainted — so the count comparison sees nothing, and only the ink check on the right file finds it. Before the reference was ink-checked too, passing the clipped file as `--reference` produced an unqualified PASS.

The count comparison, in both directions: fewer rules than the reference means the renderer dropped some; more means the arguments are swapped or the two files are not the same document. Counts rather than positions, and document-wide rather than per page, because the two backends break the same source differently — measured on one 60-row CJK table, whose row content decides where the breaks land: 5 pages vs 3 for `default`, 3 vs 15 for `warm-terra-menu`, with the rule counts identical throughout.

Calibrated across 5 themes × single- and multi-page × both argument orders, 20 runs: the 12 pairs containing no clipped file pass in both orders, and the 8 that do are caught in both orders. Separately, 14 real markdown documents × 2 themes = 28 single-file runs, zero false positives.

## Batch Convert

```bash
# Default theme, same directory
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/batch_convert.py *.md

# Specific theme, output directory, skip previews for speed
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/batch_convert.py *.md --theme warm-terra --output-dir ./pdfs --no-preview

# Mobile theme for phone reading
uv run --with weasyprint scripts/batch_convert.py *.md --theme mobile --output-dir ./mobile-pdfs --no-preview

# The border check takes several files at once, so a batch is still gated
uv run --with pdfplumber --with pillow --with numpy \
  scripts/check_table_borders.py ./pdfs/*.pdf
```

`--no-preview` switches off the visual self-check, which is the point of a batch — but it does not switch off the obligation. Run the border check over the outputs as above. It takes many files; `--reference` does not, so a batch of Chrome-rendered documents with tables needs one paired run per document.

## Anti-Pattern: Do NOT Manually Invoke pandoc + Chrome

**Why this skill exists:** Manual `pandoc input.md -o out.html` + `chrome --headless --print-to-pdf` workflows silently fail in ways that are hard to detect:

| Manual Step | What Goes Wrong | This Skill Fixes |
|---|---|---|
| `pandoc -o out.html` | No CJK-aware CSS → boxes/blanks for Chinese | Injects CJK font stack + typography patch |
| Chrome `--print-to-pdf` | Default header/footer appears (filename, date, URL, page numbers) | Passes `--no-pdf-header-footer` |
| Chrome `--print-to-pdf` on macOS | Chrome can write the PDF and then never exit (Chrome 154 does so whenever it is given `--user-data-dir`), so the command hangs; a killed Chrome also leaves a copy of the Chrome app in a temporary directory | Stops Chrome once the PDF ends in `%%EOF`, gives up after a timeout, and passes `--disable-features=MacAppCodeSignClone` |
| No post-render check | "Exit code 0" assumed success; rendering bugs hidden | Auto-generates per-page PNG previews + typography lint |
| No theme system | One-size-fits-all; phone reading impossible | Three curated themes (default / warm-terra / mobile) |
| `batch_convert.py` missing | Writing ad-hoc loops, inconsistent flags | Built-in batch mode with `--theme` support |

**Rule:** For Markdown → PDF, use this skill rather than manual pandoc/Chrome commands.
For existing Word/WPS → PDF, use the docx-creator route above.

## Troubleshooting

**Chinese characters display as boxes**: Ensure Chinese fonts are installed (Songti SC, PingFang SC, etc.)

**weasyprint import error**: Run with `uv run --with weasyprint` or use `--backend chrome` instead.

**CJK text in code blocks garbled (weasyprint)**: The script auto-detects code blocks containing Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters and converts them to styled divs with CJK-capable fonts. If you still see issues, use `--backend chrome` which has native CJK support — but if the document contains any table, clear the result with `scripts/check_table_borders.py <the chrome pdf> --reference <a weasyprint render of the same source>` — subject first, then the flag — because Chrome clips table borders past the `@page` box and the single-file form cannot see a border Chrome dropped rather than clipped (see "Chrome clips, it does not merely overflow" above). Alternatively, convert code blocks to markdown tables before generating the PDF.

**Chrome header/footer appearing**: The script passes `--no-pdf-header-footer`. If it still appears, your Chrome version may not support this flag — update Chrome. **Note:** If you bypassed this skill and used manual Chrome headless, this is the first symptom — see "Anti-Pattern" section above.

**Inline code with mixed CJK + ASCII shows blanks in macOS Preview** (e.g. `` `Terminal/终端` `` renders only `Terminal/` with the CJK part missing): weasyprint subset-embeds PingFang SC as **OpenType (CID Type 0C)**, which strict PDF readers (macOS Preview / Adobe Reader) fail to render. Chrome's PDF viewer falls back automatically and hides the bug. Fix is in the default theme: code font-family chain prioritizes **CID TrueType** CJK fonts (Songti SC / Heiti SC) before OpenType ones (PingFang SC). To verify: `pdfplumber` + check `font['fontname']` of CJK chars — if any references `PingFang-SC` (CID Type 0C OT), readers will likely fail. Reorder font chain to put CID TrueType first.

**Table column 1 with short label gets mid-broken** (e.g. `4/28（周|二）下|午`): pandoc auto-emits `<colgroup><col style="width:X%">` from dash counts in the markdown separator row. For `| ----- | --- | --- | -------- |` (uneven dash widths), pandoc allocates col 1 ~17% — too narrow for a 9-char CJK label. Inline `style=""` beats external CSS at equal specificity, so `td:first-child { width:... }` is silently shadowed. Fix is in default theme: `table colgroup col { width: auto !important }` neutralizes pandoc's hint, letting `table-layout: fixed` distribute equally (25% per column for a 4-col table). To verify: `pandoc input.md -t html | grep colgroup` — if it shows `<col style="width:X%">`, the bug applies. **Scope:** the neutralizer lives only in `default.css`; `warm-terra` and `mobile` themes use different strategies (nowrap on th/td with last-child wrap, and full-flow wrap respectively) and intentionally omit it. The neutralizer is locked in by `scripts/tests/test_cjk_tables.py::test_default_theme_neutralizes_pandoc_colgroup_hint`.

## Visual Self-Check (MANDATORY — Do Not Skip)

**This is not optional.** After every PDF generation, the script automatically:

1. Converts each page to PNG via `pdftoppm` (poppler-utils) into a `<pdf-name>/` subdirectory under the **system temp dir** (NOT next to the PDF — previews are a throwaway self-check artifact and must never linger in your working tree / git repo). The exact path is printed after the run as `Previews: <path>/page-NN.png`; the files themselves are `page-1.png`, `page-2.png`, … with no zero padding
2. Prints a structured self-check checklist reminding the caller to visually inspect each page
3. Runs typography lint to detect CJK line-break anti-patterns

**Why mandatory**: "PDF generated cleanly" ≠ "rendering matches markdown intent". Common silent failures include:
- Paragraphs collapsing into one (CommonMark soft-break on consecutive non-blank lines)
- Tables overflowing page margins
- Tables missing their right border while the text stays intact (Chrome clip — the one failure on this list that does not look like a failure; `scripts/check_table_borders.py` decides it, and on a Chrome render only its `--reference` form is a verdict)
- Missing CJK / emoji glyphs
- Code block garbling
- Chrome default headers/footers (if bypassed this skill)

**Workflow**, at the pause point between generating and delivering — two steps, and the second is not covered by the first:

1. **Read the pages.** `Read` each `page-N.png` at the printed `Previews:` path and verify against the markdown source. If anything renders differently from intent, **fix the markdown** (use `- ` real lists instead of pseudo-lists, insert blank lines, restructure tables) and rerun. The script does NOT silently "fix" non-standard markdown — that would mask the signal that the source is wrong, causing the same markdown to render incorrectly in other processors (Obsidian, GitHub, VS Code preview).

2. **If the document has any table, run `scripts/check_table_borders.py` on the PDF** — and if the render went through Chrome, run its `--reference` form, which is the only form that is a verdict there (both forms are in "Chrome clips, it does not merely overflow" above). Step 1 cannot substitute for this. The missing border reads as a styling choice, and the checklist in step 1 primes you to look for text cut off, which is exactly what does not happen. Do not deliver a PDF with tables on the strength of step 1 alone.

Neither step catches everything. The PNGs come from `pdftoppm`, which renders CID Type 0C fonts that macOS Preview and Adobe Reader show as blanks — so a font-embedding defect can look perfect in step 1 and be unreadable on the recipient's machine. That one is handled by theme routing, not by looking (see "Backends"); the check to run by hand is in Troubleshooting under "Inline code with mixed CJK + ASCII".

**Disable** with `--no-preview` for batch / non-interactive runs:

```bash
python scripts/md_to_pdf.py input.md output.pdf --no-preview
```

**Requires** `pdftoppm` (`brew install poppler` on macOS). If not installed, the script logs a hint and skips preview generation but still produces the PDF.

## CJK Typography (default behavior)

The script applies two layers of CJK-aware processing automatically — **without modifying the user's markdown source or theme CSS files**:

### Layer 1: CSS patch (auto-injected, fixes ~80% of cases)

`_load_theme()` appends a CJK typography CSS patch to the loaded theme CSS. The patch:

- `table { table-layout: fixed; width: 100% }` — equal column widths prevent weasyprint auto-layout from squeezing one column to ~10% width when an adjacent column has 5x more content
- `td, th { word-break: keep-all; overflow-wrap: normal; line-break: strict }` — don't slice CJK characters apart. The deliberate trade-off encoded by `overflow-wrap: normal` (not `break-word`) is to let content overflow slightly rather than fall back to mid-token breaks — rationale documented in the `CJK typography patch (auto-injected` comment block in `md_to_pdf.py` and locked in by `scripts/tests/test_cjk_tables.py`
- `th { white-space: nowrap }` — short headers stay one line for predictable column widths

This silently fixes the most common anti-pattern (cell content forcibly wrapped between CJK characters producing single-char-only lines), without touching the user's source. The user's theme CSS file on disk is never modified.

### Layer 2: Typography lint (post-render detection, catches the rest)

After PDF generation, the script runs `pdftotext -layout` per page and scans for known CJK anti-patterns per "中文文案排版指北" (Chinese typography style guide):

- Single CJK character alone on a line (cell still too narrow even after Layer 1)
- Line ending with `（` followed by content next line (broken bracket pair)
- Line starting with `）` (broken from previous bracket pair)
- Short line ending with mid-thought punctuation `、，；：`

Findings are printed to stderr with page+line locations. They are **warnings, not errors** — PDF still generates. The author sees the finding and decides:

1. Accept (e.g. one orphan char in a long doc may be acceptable)
2. Shorten the offending cell content to fit the column width
3. Restructure (e.g. move long content into a paragraph below the table)

### Why not silently auto-fix everything?

Layer 2 deliberately does NOT modify the markdown. Per CLAUDE.md "禁止隐式行为" rule: silently rewriting non-standard markdown (e.g. expanding pseudo-lists into real lists) would mask the signal that the source is wrong, causing the same markdown to render incorrectly in other processors. Layer 1 is acceptable because it patches **rendering behavior** for already-standard markdown (a standard table that weasyprint happens to render imperfectly for CJK), not the markdown source itself.

### Known limitations

When a single cell's content is just slightly longer than the available column width (e.g. 10 CJK chars in a 9-char-wide cell after equal split), weasyprint will fall back to forced break despite `keep-all`. Layer 1 cannot fix this — Layer 2 will catch it and prompt the author to shorten cell content or restructure.
