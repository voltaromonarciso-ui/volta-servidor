#!/usr/bin/env bash
# git_find_all_checkouts.sh — enumerate EVERY checkout of this repository on this machine,
# including the ones `git worktree list` is structurally blind to.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the blind spot that makes every other audit incomplete):
#   `git worktree list` only knows LINKED worktrees — checkouts made with `git worktree add`,
#   whose `.git` is a gitlink *file* pointing back to this repository. An INDEPENDENT CLONE
#   (a second `git clone` of the same remote, or a copied directory) has its own complete
#   `.git` directory and no back-reference, so it appears in NONE of the usual instruments:
#   not `git worktree list`, not `git branch -a`, not `git fsck`, not `git stash list`,
#   not `git log --not --remotes` — all of those only ever see the repository they run in.
#
#   So an audit that enumerates checkouts via `git worktree list` will confidently report
#   "nothing at risk" while unpushed commits and uncommitted files sit in a sibling clone.
#   Untracked files are the worst case: no bundle, no `git archive`, and no `format-patch`
#   can reach a file git was never told about, so the only copy is the one on disk.
#
#   Real incident: a session stopped mid-flight and left 440 lines of a working feature as
#   untracked files in a sibling clone. The repository's own audit was clean, every branch
#   was pushed, and the work was still one `rm -rf` away from being gone for good.
#
# THE SECOND AXIS — FRESHNESS:
#   `unpushed` below is measured against the checkout's repository-wide `origin/*` refs,
#   which are a CACHED SNAPSHOT from its last fetch, not the remote. Linked worktrees share
#   those refs, but each checkout can write its own private FETCH_HEAD receipt. Report the
#   newest receipt across the common Git dir and all linked-worktree admin dirs; reading only
#   either side makes a fresh shared ref cache look stale when fetch ran from the other side.
#
#   Read the number in the right direction. For "what would be lost" a stale cache is safe:
#   it can only over-report unpushed work, never hide it. For "is this already upstream?" it
#   fails the other way — work the remote already has reads as unique, and re-shipping it can
#   revert whatever was built on top of it in the meantime. Fetch before that second question.
#
# NON-DESTRUCTIVE: runs only `find` plus read-only Git queries. Repository-provided
# fsmonitor commands are disabled and optional index refreshes are suppressed before
# inspecting discovered checkouts. It never fetches, writes refs, stages, or touches a
# file. Safe to run in a dirty tree and alongside other agents.
#
# USAGE:
#   scripts/git_find_all_checkouts.sh [search-root ...]
#
#   With no arguments it searches the parent and grandparent of this repository — where
#   sibling clones actually accumulate (`~/workspace/js/repo` plus `~/workspace/repo-hotfix`).
#   Pass explicit roots to widen (`~`) or narrow the sweep. Set DEPTH=<n> to change how deep
#   each root is scanned (default 4; raise it for deeply nested layouts). Set STALE_AFTER=<s>
#   to change when a checkout's cached remote refs are called stale (default 3600 seconds).
#
# EXIT: 0 when no OTHER checkout holds at-risk work; 1 when any other checkout has
# uncommitted changes, untracked files, or unpushed commits; 2 if not run inside a Git repo.

# BSD (macOS) and GNU stat disagree on the mtime flag, and they disagree destructively:

# reflog-based age reads "old" after a fetch that found no news, which is the opposite
# of what we need. Remote-tracking refs are common, but FETCH_HEAD itself is not: a fetch from
# the primary checkout writes <common>/FETCH_HEAD, while a fetch from a linked checkout can
# write <common>/worktrees/<name>/FETCH_HEAD. Use the newest receipt in that common-dir group
# so every linked checkout reports the freshness of the same shared ref cache. Prints seconds;

FRESHNESS: some checkout above has not fetched recently, so its `unpushed` count was measured
against a cached snapshot of the remote. That direction is safe for "what would be lost" — a
stale cache over-reports unpushed work, it cannot hide it. It is NOT safe for the opposite
question. Before concluding a branch is unmerged, or that local work still needs shipping:

  git fetch --all --prune

Skipping that has a specific failure shape: work the remote already has reads as unique, so it
gets re-shipped — and if the remote improved it in the meantime, the "restore" reverts those
improvements while looking like a rescue.

Each AT-RISK checkout may hold work that is not proven preserved elsewhere. Before deleting it:
  1. Untracked files      -> copy them out of the tree (nothing in git can reach them).
  2. Uncommitted changes  -> `git -C <checkout> diff > <backup>/uncommitted.diff`.
  3. Unpushed commits     -> `git -C <checkout> bundle create <backup>/history.bundle HEAD --not --remotes`
                             (verify it: `git bundle verify <backup>/history.bundle`).
Then judge each item by CONTENT against the surviving repository — a branch name, a commit
message, or "it looks old" is not evidence that the work already landed.
