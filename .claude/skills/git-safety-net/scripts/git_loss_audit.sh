# git_loss_audit.sh — report what local Git work is at risk of loss. NON-DESTRUCTIVE.
#
# Answers the authoritative "would I actually lose anything?" questions across EVERY local place
# work hides — not just branches:
#   1. LOCAL-ONLY commits — reachable from the current HEAD, any linked-worktree HEAD, a local
#      branch, or a tag, but on NO remote. Enumerating every worktree HEAD catches detached commits
#      in another checkout that `git log HEAD --branches --tags` misses.
#   2. WORKTREES — every checkout is inspected for tracked and untracked changes. A clean branch
#      does not make a dirty linked worktree safe to remove.
#   3. STASHES — `git stash` entries are local-only by nature and a classic loss vector.
#   4. DANGLING commits — orphaned objects (dropped stashes, rebase leftovers, abandoned resets).
#      Reflog-reachable now, but eligible for `git gc` later. (git fsck --dangling)
#
# It refreshes remote-tracking refs with `fetch`, then only inspects repository/worktree state. It
# never changes working files, commits, branches, stashes, or user-authored refs.
#
# Usage (run from anywhere inside the repo):
#   git_loss_audit.sh [remote]        # remote defaults to "origin"
# Caller boundary: this script has no exclusions and inspects every linked worktree, local
# branch/tag, stash, and dangling commit. Run it only when that whole evidence surface is in scope.
#
# Exit code: 0 if nothing is at surprising risk, 1 if LOCAL-ONLY commits or dirty/inaccessible
# worktrees exist, 2 if not run inside a Git repository. Stashes and dangling commits are reported
# but stay exit 0 (known/recoverable, not a surprise).
