# git_preserve_danglers.sh — make orphaned commits un-loseable BEFORE any cleanup. Additive-only.
#
# Dangling commits (dropped stashes, rebase leftovers, abandoned resets, detached-HEAD work) are
# recoverable ONLY until `git gc` runs. This pins each one under a hidden ref namespace
# refs/dangling-backup/<sha> — a referenced object is never garbage-collected — so they survive
# gc without cluttering `git branch` or `git stash list`. Optionally exports a .patch per commit.
#
# It only ever runs read-only git plus `git update-ref` to ADD refs. It never deletes a ref,
# never checks out, never resets, never runs gc — so it cannot make a loss worse.
#
# Usage (run from anywhere inside the repo):
#   git_preserve_danglers.sh                       # pin all dangling commits
#   git_preserve_danglers.sh --patch-dir DIR       # pin AND write DIR/<shortsha>-<slug>.patch each
# Caller boundary: there is no per-SHA filter. Run only when every dangling commit the script will
# enumerate is inside the preservation scope; otherwise use targeted `git update-ref` from SKILL.md.
#
# After running, `git for-each-ref refs/dangling-backup/` lists what was pinned. To unpin later
# (only once you've confirmed the content is safe on a remote), see the SKILL.md troubleshooting.
