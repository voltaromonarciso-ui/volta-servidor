## Mental model: nothing is gone until gc runs

A commit is an immutable object in `.git/objects`. Deleting a branch, `reset --hard`, a bad
rebase, or `stash drop` only removes a *reference* to the commit — the object itself survives
until `git gc` prunes unreachable objects. The reflog keeps a ref alive for **~90 days**
(reachable) / **~30 days** (already unreachable), which is why same-day recovery almost always
works. So the recovery mindset is: **find the dangling object, point a ref at it, done.** The
one thing that permanently loses work is `gc` running while nothing references it — which is why
"preserve before cleanup" (below) matters.

**Deleting a branch is the exception to that rule.** `git branch -D <name>` deletes the branch's own
reflog (`logs/refs/heads/<name>`) along with the ref, so the "~90 days" window quoted above does
**not** cover the deleted branch's tip. What keeps it alive afterwards is only whatever *other* reflog
happens to mention it — HEAD's own, or a checkout record — and that is luck, not a window you can
plan around. Measured 2026-09-22 on a scratch repo: after deleting a checked-out branch,
`git gc --prune=now` still kept the tip (HEAD's reflog was a reachability root), and only
`git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all` followed by `gc --prune=now` took it.
**So "gc has not taken it yet" is not a safety signal — the object is one expire away.**
**Criterion: before `-D`, capture the tip with `git rev-parse <branch>` and run
`git cat-file -e "<sha>^{commit}"`; 0 means the object is in the local store, and that is the case worth
preserving.** Non-zero is genuinely ambiguous *for this form*, so do not read it as a verdict either
way: its stderr is always `fatal: Not a valid object name <whatever-you-typed>^{commit}`, so a
mistyped SHA and an object `gc` already collected print the same words (measured 2026-09-22). What
settles it in practice — if the SHA came straight from `git rev-parse` moments ago, non-zero means the
local object is already gone and the only copies left are whatever you pinned or pushed earlier.
**Which is why the pin/push below happens *before* the delete, not after reading this probe.** (The
`… -e <branch>:<path>` form has the richer stderr — it distinguishes a missing path from a bad branch
— but it answers a different question; see [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Troubleshooting.) Nor are a
successful probe plus a completed preserve deletion authority: worktree-removal authority does not
authorize branch deletion ([merge_verification.md](merge_verification.md) § Worktree retirement) —
`-D` still needs the verified backup and explicit authorization.

## The authoritative "is anything at risk" check

Before anything else, answer the only question that matters — *is any committed or uncommitted
state present only locally?* When every worktree/ref/tag/stash/dangler enumerated by the full audit
is inside the declared evidence scope, check every place local work hides:

```bash
scripts/git_loss_audit.sh
```

If any enumerated surface is excluded, the script is out of scope because it has no exclusion flag.
Use the authorized checkout/ref's own `status`, `HEAD`, `git log HEAD --not --remotes`, and exact
remote-ref lookup instead, and state that other worktrees/refs/tags/stashes/danglers were not audited.

- **A completely empty verdict = no reported local state is stranded off-remote.** That means no
  local-only commits, dirty/unavailable worktrees, stashes, or dangling commits.
- **Any reported item = inspect it before cleanup.** Local-only commits and dirty/unavailable
  worktrees make the script exit 1; stashes/danglers stay exit 0 but still need triage or
  preservation before branch, stash, or worktree deletion.

Why the script instead of only `git log HEAD --branches --tags --not --remotes`: that command
catches the current detached HEAD and tag-only commits, but misses a detached HEAD in a different
linked worktree and every uncommitted tracked/untracked file. The script enumerates all worktree
HEADs and inspects each checkout directly.

Do **not** substitute `git status` or ahead/behind counts for this — they answer different
questions. To confirm a single commit is safe on a remote:

```bash
git branch -r --contains <sha>       # lists remote branches that contain it (empty = local-only)
```

## Linked worktrees and detached worktree HEADs

Treat each authorized path from `git worktree list --porcelain` as a separate working tree. Run
status with `git -C <path>` only against paths inside the evidence scope. A detached linked worktree
can carry a unique commit even when every named branch is on a remote; the full loss audit includes
those HEADs explicitly, so do not run it when another linked path is excluded.

Before removal, require empty tracked/untracked status **and a separate ignored-file inventory**,
exact HEAD capture, content containment proof against a fresh base, a verified targeted bundle of
the worktree's branch or collision-checked recovery ref, and current-session deletion authority.
Only then use non-forced `git worktree remove`, followed by path/registration/ref postcondition
checks. The bundle preserves Git objects, not ignored files; copy any ignored item that is not
proven reproducible and verify it against a recorded pre-removal
content hash. Freeze the complete ignored path/type/hash-or-link-target manifest, including
disposable entries. After authority, repeat both status checks and rebuild that manifest; any
added, missing, or changed entry aborts, and the removal command must come next. Recheck every
surviving copy afterward. The complete gate lives in
[merge_verification.md](merge_verification.md) § Worktree retirement.

## Ladder step 1 — `git reflog` (first move)

Any "I lost a commit / reset too far / bad rebase" starts here:

```bash
git reflog --date=iso | head -40
```

Each line is a past HEAD position with its sha and what moved it (`commit`, `checkout`, `reset`,
`rebase -i (finish)`, …). Find the sha of the state you want back, **confirm it**, then recover
onto a *new* branch (never reset your live branch onto it):

```bash
git show <sha>                       # CONFIRM: is this the content you want?
git switch -c rescue/<name> <sha>    # or: git branch rescue/<name> <sha>
```

Branch-specific reflogs exist too: `git reflog show <branch>` recovers where a specific branch
tip used to point (e.g. before a force-push clobbered it).

## Ladder step 2 — dropped stashes

`git stash drop` / `git stash pop` (which drops on success) removes the stash ref but leaves the
underlying commit dangling. `git stash list` won't show it; find it via fsck:

```bash
git fsck --no-reflogs --unreachable | grep commit    # or: git fsck --dangling
git show <stash-sha>                                 # verify it's the stash you lost
git stash apply <stash-sha>                           # re-apply it, or:
git branch rescue/stash <stash-sha>                   # park it on a branch
```

Stash commits have a distinctive message (`WIP on <branch>: …`), which helps identify them among
fsck output.

**The third parent — untracked files a stash silently carries.** A stash made with
`git stash -u` (or `-a`) stores untracked files in a **third parent commit** (`stash@{N}^3`),
and `git stash show -p` **does not display them** — it only shows the tracked diff. Two
consequences that bite in real recoveries:

- **Inspecting**: judging a stash by `stash show -p` alone under-reports what it holds. Check for
  the third parent explicitly, and list what's inside:

  ```bash
  git rev-parse -q --verify 'stash@{0}^3' && git ls-tree -r --name-only 'stash@{0}^3'
  ```

- **Exporting**: a `.patch` backup of the stash loses the untracked half. Export both parts —
  patch for the tracked diff, `git archive` for the third-parent tree:

  ```bash
  git stash show -p --binary 'stash@{0}' > stash0.patch
  git archive 'stash@{0}^3' -o stash0-untracked.tar     # only if ^3 exists
  ```

  `scripts/git_export_before_drop.sh` does both automatically for every stash it exports.
  (Real case: a "finish later" stash carried 10 untracked files — 929 insertions including a
  545-line test file — that a patch-only backup would have dropped without a word.)

**Index-shift trap when dropping several stashes**: indices renumber on every drop —
after `drop stash@{0}`, the old `stash@{1}` *becomes* `stash@{0}`. Drop from the **highest
index down** so each name still means what your backups say it means.

## Ladder step 3 — detached-HEAD work

Committing while on a detached HEAD (after `git checkout <sha>`), then switching away, orphans
those commits — they belong to no branch. Reflog remembers them:

```bash
git reflog | grep -i 'HEAD@'         # find the detached commits you made
git switch -c saved-work <sha>        # give them a home
```

**Prevent the loss entirely:** the moment you make a commit you care about on a detached HEAD,
`git switch -c <branch> HEAD` before doing anything else.

## Ladder step 4 — `git fsck` for true orphans

When reflog doesn't reach it (reflog expired, or the commit was never HEAD on this clone), fsck
walks the object store directly:

```bash
git fsck --dangling                  # dangling commits/blobs/trees not reachable from any ref
```

Inspect candidates with `git show <sha>`. Dangling *blobs* can be a single lost file:
`git show <blob-sha> > recovered_file`.

**One more place to check before declaring a deleted branch gone: the hosting platform, not
just this local clone.** If the branch had an open or merged pull request, GitHub keeps that
PR's head addressable at `refs/pull/<N>/head` even after the source branch itself is deleted
(verified on a real repository: `refs/pull/<N>/head` still resolved to the original head SHA
after the branch was deleted). Check read-only first, then fetch and recover:

```bash
git ls-remote origin "refs/pull/<N>/head"                  # read-only: does it still resolve?
git fetch origin "refs/pull/<N>/head"
git branch restored/pr-<N> FETCH_HEAD
```

Other hosting platforms expose this under different ref names — check what the platform
actually serves before assuming this exact path works there too.

## Preserve: pin authorized danglers so gc can never take them

Dangling commits are recoverable **only until gc runs**. For a specific inspected commit that is
inside the preservation scope, pin exactly that SHA under a hidden ref namespace—a referenced
object is never collected:

```bash
git update-ref refs/dangling-backup/<sha> <sha> 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
git show refs/dangling-backup/<sha>       # confirm the exact object that was pinned
```

Use `scripts/git_preserve_danglers.sh` only when the Outcome contract explicitly includes every
dangling commit it will enumerate; it is a whole-set helper, not the default. Why a hidden
`refs/dangling-backup/*` and not `git stash store`? These refs don't appear in `git branch` or
`git stash list`, so they protect the authorized objects without turning branch/stash lists into
noise, and you can delete them once their content is verified safe elsewhere.

Bundling that same commit needs a ref too — `git bundle create` refuses a bare SHA with
`fatal: Refusing to create empty bundle` even though the commit exists (measured). Bundle the
`refs/dangling-backup/<sha>` ref just pinned above by name; a commit with no ref at all needs one
created first (`git update-ref refs/backup/<name> <sha>`) before it can be bundled.

**The same error string names more than one cause, and one of them is a trap.** Above: "the positive
revision has no ref" (a bare SHA) — create a ref first. Below: "the negation range is empty", meaning
`<sha>`'s content is **already in** the ref you excluded and there is no increment to preserve; measured
2026-09-22 across three repos, it fired on exactly the branches the patch-id set comparison had already
confirmed contained. The trap: `git bundle create out.bundle ^<ref> <bare-sha-not-in-<ref>>` prints the
*identical* message while the real cause is still "no ref" — building that SHA into a ref first makes
the bundle succeed. **Criterion: never branch on the error string. Create the ref first
(`git update-ref refs/backup/<name> <sha>`), retry, and only an empty result *then* means "nothing to
preserve". The cross-check is `git format-patch <merge-base>..<head>`, read as "no output **and exit
0**" — an empty stdout with a non-zero exit is a malformed range, not containment.**

## Triple-backup a critical commit

For a specific commit you must not lose (e.g. real unpushed work found by the at-risk check), one
copy isn't enough — a single disk failure or a single `gc` shouldn't be able to take it. Give it
three independent homes:

```bash
git branch backup/<name> <sha>                                   # 1) local branch
git push origin backup/<name>                                    # 2) remote branch (survives disk loss)
git format-patch -1 <sha> --stdout > <name>.patch                # 3) patch file (survives repo loss)
```

Now the commit survives losing any one of: the working tree, the remote, or the whole repo.

## Widen the safety window (config)

The default reflog window is generous but finite. For repos where recovery matters, extend it:

```bash
git config --global gc.reflogExpire "180 days"
git config --global gc.reflogExpireUnreachable "90 days"
```

## Destructive-operation safety (reset / force-push / rewrite)

Recovery is easiest when the operation that "lost" the work was itself reversible. Prefer:

- **On already-pushed history, `git revert`, not `git reset`.** Revert adds an inverse commit;
  reset abandons commits that teammates may have based work on.
- **If you must force-push, use `git push --force-with-lease`, not `--force`.** `--force-with-lease`
  refuses the push if the remote moved since you last fetched — it won't silently clobber a
  teammate's (or another agent's) commits.
- **Before any history rewrite (`rebase`, `filter-repo`, `reset --hard`), snapshot first:**
  `git branch backup/pre-rewrite` (and run the at-risk check). Ten seconds; fully reversible.
