"""skill-install-audit.py — read-only reconciliation of plugin and Codex source installation state.

Inspect installation state across the following sources. This is an inventory,
not a fresh-host discovery or successful-execution check:

  1. REGISTRY   each local marketplace's .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
  2. INSTALLED  ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json  (shared via symlink)
  3. ENABLED    ~/.claude/settings.json enabledPlugins    (the authoritative map; profiles
                are converged onto it by claude-plugins-sync.py)
  4. CODEX      ~/.config/claude-switch-models-setup/codex-active-skills.json manifest vs
                the real ~/.agents/skills entries
  5. RUNTIME    the plugin version the background sync daemon actually executes, vs the
                version registered in the source marketplace
  6. FRESHNESS  whether the local checkouts every layer above is read from are themselves
                behind their already-fetched remote-tracking refs

Result sections (the human report prints each section, including empty sections):

  ENABLED                  installed + enabledPlugins true for the same NAME@marketplace
  INSTALLED_DISABLED       installed, explicitly false in enabledPlugins
  INSTALLED_NO_KEY         installed, no enabledPlugins entry (NOT visible by default)
  REGISTERED_NOT_INSTALLED in a marketplace.json but never installed
  ORPHAN_INSTALLED         installed plugin absent from its loaded owning marketplace registry
  DAEMON_RUNTIME_LAG       the sync daemon runs a pinned copy older than the source, so every
                           fix shipped to this repo stays invisible to it until the pin moves
  SOURCE_CHECKOUT_BEHIND   a registry checkout is behind its remote-tracking ref, so every
                           finding above was judged against a stale reference
  PROFILE_ONLY_RISK        enabledPlugins keys present in a profile but absent from main —
                           pre-fix these were wiped by the next mirror; now they are adopted
                           or preserved, but conflicts still deserve eyeballs
  MANUAL_LINK_RISK         absolute symlink owned by a successfully loaded source, but not
                           selected by activation policy -> the source-sync daemon will prune it;
                           ownership follows the source-sync classifier; relative links are preserved
  CODEX_UNLISTED_ENABLED   Skill members of enabled owned plugins absent from both expanded
                           activation policy and verified links (informational if unwanted)
  CODEX_SELECTED_MISSING   selected Skill names without a verified link to their registered
                           source, including missing, dangling, wrong-source or unregistered names

Plugin sections use NAME@marketplace identities; Codex sections use Skill names,
including suite members and selections expanded from active_marketplaces.
Claude personal links and claude_active_marketplaces are not audited here; use the
source sync dry-run and a fresh Claude catalog probe for that route.
Exit 0 means the inventory completed, even when findings are present. Without
--json, an unknown --list section exits 2; --json takes precedence over --list.
Missing configured registries are warned and skipped, but selected marketplaces
require available sources. Invalid or unreadable required configuration fails.
Use references/troubleshooting.md for repair and fresh-host acceptance steps.

Usage:
    python3 skill-install-audit.py            # human-readable report
    python3 skill-install-audit.py --json     # machine-readable
    python3 skill-install-audit.py --list ENABLED INSTALLED_DISABLED

Env overrides for this audit:

    CLAUDE_PROFILES_DIR      profile directories whose enabled state is inspected
    AGENTS_SKILLS_DIR        Codex user Skill root to inspect
    CODEX_ACTIVE_SKILLS      activation manifest path (audit-only; the source syncer
                            uses --active-skills-manifest)
    SKILL_SYNC_DAEMON_ENTRY  deployed daemon entry path (audit-only)
