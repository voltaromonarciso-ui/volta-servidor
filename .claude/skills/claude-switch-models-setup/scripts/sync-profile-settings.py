"""Converge Claude Code profile settings.json onto the main profile's.

Goal (2026-07-18, user directive): except for the model/provider, every
profile supports the same functionality as the main (official) profile —
same hooks, marketplaces, plugin set, env feature flags, permissions and
behavior preferences. The plugin STATE is already shared via symlinks
(plugins/{cache,data,installed_plugins.json}); this script converges the
CONFIG layer (settings.json), which is per-profile by design and had fully
drifted (9/9 profiles had zero hooks, 7/9 had zero marketplaces, all had
no env feature flags).

Two denylists define the identity boundary — these are NEVER synced:

1. DENYLIST top-level keys: the profile's provider identity (`model`).
2. ENV_KEY_DENYLIST env vars: provider-routing and Anthropic-native
   isolation flags. Provider routing lives in ~/.claude/settings/<name>.json
   (ANTHROPIC_MODEL / BASE_URL / AUTH_TOKEN per window), and third-party
   profiles deliberately run ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false plus DISABLE_* flags
   because those features are Anthropic-native and fail with 400s against
   third-party endpoints. Syncing main's values over them breaks the
   isolation the profiles were built for — parity means "everything that
   CAN work there", not "smear Anthropic-only flags everywhere".

Merge rule: every key present in main's settings.json overwrites the
profile's, except denylisted ones; `env` converges both ways for non-identity
keys — main's keys overwrite the profile's, and a non-identity key main no
longer carries is DELETED from the profile. Identity keys are exempt: main
never carries them, so their absence from main is not evidence of deletion.
Deletion propagation landed 2026-09-24 — before it, `env` was additive-only,
so three tokens removed from main's env survived in all 15 profile files and
had to be cleared by hand (sync's own merge would never converge them).
Profile-only TOP-LEVEL keys (absent from main) are
PRESERVED — sync is additive at the top level and never deletes them;
--check lists them so drift stays visible. Nested collections inside a
key main also has (permissions.allow, enabledPlugins, ...) are NOT
preserved item-by-item: the whole key converges to main's value, and any
profile-only nested entries dropped that way are listed (detail under
--check, count on write) so the loss is visible, never silent.

--- Layer 2: per-profile `.claude.json` behavior keys (added 2026-08-17) ---

settings.json is not the only per-profile config layer. Claude Code also
keeps a `<config-dir>/.claude.json` per profile (`~/.claude.json` for the
main one), and a handful of BEHAVIOR settings live only there — e.g.
`workflowSizeGuideline`. On 2026-08-17 that key was set to "small" on the
main profile while 10/11 third-party profiles had no copy at all; a Kimi
session then fanned a Dynamic Workflow out to 30+ agents with no size
guidance in its system prompt. So this script ALSO converges the behavior
slice of each profile's `.claude.json`.

That file mixes three kinds of keys, and the classifier — not a hand
maintained full list — is the safety mechanism, because new keys appear
with every Claude Code release and a whitelist of "known behavior keys"
alone would silently miss the next one:

1. BEHAVIOR_KEYS (explicit allowlist) — synced main -> profile.
2. State keys (is_state_key(): prefixes/substrings/exact names) — per-
   profile runtime state, caches, counters, migration flags, identity and
   credentials. NEVER synced; syncing them would smear one profile's
   session state or account identity onto another.
3. Everything else is GRAY: if main and a profile differ on a gray key,
   the drift is REPORTED (never auto-written) — one line per drifted key
   per run, until a human classifies it: move it into BEHAVIOR_KEYS,
   teach is_state_key() its pattern, or park it in GRAY_ACKNOWLEDGED
   with a reason. This is the tripwire that surfaces the next
   `workflowSizeGuideline` the day it appears, instead of after the
   next incident.

Write-safety for this layer, measured before shipping (2026-08-17): a
marker key written into an ACTIVE profile's `.claude.json` survived 30+
minutes of the running harness rewriting the file — writes are merged,
not full-file clobbers, and SessionStart re-runs make the sync convergent
regardless. Backup + atomic replace + post-write validation apply here
too; the main profile's own `.claude.json` is never written (it is the
SSOT), and a profile missing `.claude.json` is skipped, never created.

Modes — the flag set selects write-vs-audit and strict-vs-lenient, and nothing
else. Scope is EVERY profile in all of them:
  (no args)   SessionStart mode — converge every profile under
              ~/.claude-profiles/* plus $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. Silent when
              converged; one line per profile per layer when it synced.
              Never blocks the session: a corrupt main aborts convergence
              with exit 0, an unreadable profile is reported and skipped, and
              an unexpected exception prints a traceback and still exits 0.
  --all       same scope, same writes; human-run, so it is strict — a corrupt
              main exits 2, and so does a profile that could not be read (a
              strict mode exits 2 so an audit cannot claim to have covered
              profiles it never reached). Kept as the explicit form the docs
              tell you to run after a manual settings edit — it is no longer
              what makes a run cover every profile.
  --check     audit every profile, write nothing; exit 1 when drifted, exit 2
              when a main file is corrupt (a corrupt main reads as empty and
              would otherwise fake-green the audit) or a profile could not be
              read. `--check --all` is the same audit.

Scope used to mean "the profile this session happens to live in" for the
argument-free call, and nothing ran `--all` on a schedule — so a hook added to
the main profile only reached the profiles that had started a session since.
Measured 2026-09-19: `llm-entry-guard` registered on 4/14 profiles, three more
hooks on 5-6/14, and no output anywhere naming the gap. The default is
therefore "converge everything": the next profile to start a session carries
the backlog for every profile that had not.

Three things make that default safe to have, and each one used to be derived
from `interactive = bool(args)` or from the single-profile scope:
1. Scope is not a flag. Adding a scope flag can never again silently widen or
   narrow what a SessionStart run touches.
2. Strictness is not a flag count. `--all` — a human asking for wider coverage
   — also used to switch on "exit 2 on a corrupt main", which is exactly why
   "just add `--all` to the hook command" is not the fix: it would turn a
   corrupt main file into a blocked session. Each mode now declares its own
   strictness, and an unlisted flag set is refused rather than falling through.
3. The two blast radii a single-profile scope had kept local are closed: one
   malformed profile can no longer cancel the run for the others, and
   $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is unioned in only when it already looks like a profile
   (an unset value resolves to the cwd, and the settings layer creates files).

Asymmetry worth knowing when maintaining this: the settings.json layer
CREATES a profile's settings.json if missing (pure config, harmless), while
the .claude.json layer SKIPS a missing file (the harness creates it on first
launch, and it carries identity/session state a sync must not fabricate).
Also, every mode converges every profile under PROFILES_ROOT and unions in
$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR when it already carries a config file — that file is what
keeps an unset variable from resolving to the cwd and having a settings.json
fabricated into it.

⚠️ NEVER run this script with a synthetic CLAUDE_MAIN_CONFIG_DIR while
CLAUDE_PROFILES_ROOT or $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR still reaches a real profile. The
union scope then converges that real profile toward the fake main: its whole
`hooks` object is replaced by whatever the fake main holds and its `env` gains
the fake main's keys, so every guard registered there stops firing. The run does
name `hooks` among the keys it synced (and, when the overwrite drops
profile-only entries, reports how many), so it reads as routine convergence —
nothing says guards are gone.
All three variables must point at synthetic, disposable directories together;
a synthetic main alone is not safe.

Before a manual run, `echo "$CLAUDE_MAIN_CONFIG_DIR" "$CLAUDE_PROFILES_ROOT"
"$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR"`. An unset CLAUDE_PROFILES_ROOT is not a green light: it
defaults to the real ~/.claude-profiles, so every real profile converges. Test
fixtures must build the subprocess env from a scrubbed base, not from the live
one: `env -u CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR -u CLAUDE_MAIN_CONFIG_DIR
-u CLAUDE_PROFILES_ROOT …`. A shell profile sets these variables, and `unset`
inside a script does not reliably reach a child process.

To decide whether a run wrote anything, compare the target profile's
settings.json SIZE AND BYTES. `.sync-backup` is written with shutil.copy2,
which preserves the source mtime — an old backup timestamp therefore proves
nothing about whether a write happened.

Backup: before each write, target is copied to <file>.sync-backup
(single rolling file, chmod 600 regardless of source permissions); writes
are atomic (tmp + os.replace) and validated.

    the variable is unset or empty, and `Path('.').is_dir()` is unconditionally

    the settings layer creates a settings.json there, fabricating a profile in
    whatever directory the session happened to start in and then reporting it
    as converged forever. A genuine profile always has at least one of the two
    config files by the time a SessionStart hook runs (the harness writes
    `.claude.json` at launch); a project directory has neither.

    Applied to the unioned dir ONLY. A directory under PROFILES_ROOT is a
