Claude Code multi-profile plugin sync (replaces the old fix-marketplace-paths.py).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Claude Code validates a marketplace's installLocation with `path.resolve()`, which
normalises a path string but does NOT resolve symlinks. The check is roughly:

    c = path.resolve(<CURRENT_CONFIG_DIR>/plugins/marketplaces)
    u = path.resolve(installLocation)
    if (u !== c && !u.startsWith(c + sep)) -> "corrupted installLocation"

Each profile runs with its own CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, so `c` is a DIFFERENT literal string
per profile (~/.claude/... vs ~/.claude-profiles/kimi/... vs ~/.claude-profiles/deepseek/...),
and none is a prefix of another. Therefore a single SHARED known_marketplaces.json can
never satisfy more than one profile at a time.

If you symlink the whole plugins/ dir across profiles (the naive "install once, share
everywhere" approach), every profile ends up pointing at ONE physical
known_marketplaces.json, and whichever profile last wrote it wins — every OTHER profile
plus the default config then reports "corrupted installLocation". (The old
fix-marketplace-paths.py made this worse, not better: it rewrote that shared file to one
profile's prefix on every launch.)

THE FIX (idempotent)
--------------------
- Marketplace CONTENT stays shared (plugins/marketplaces, cache, data, ...): one copy on
  disk, symlinked into each profile -> still "install once, all profiles see it".
- known_marketplaces.json becomes PER-PROFILE and independent: each profile's copy stores
  installLocation with ITS OWN config-dir prefix, so each profile validates against itself
  and never corrupts.

Each ~/.claude-profiles/<p>/plugins becomes a REAL directory:
    marketplaces -> symlink ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces   (shared content)
    cache        -> symlink ~/.claude/plugins/cache          (shared content)
    installed_plugins.json -> symlink ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
    ... every other item -> symlink ~/.claude/plugins/<item>
    known_marketplaces.json  = independent real file (this profile's prefix)

~/.claude (the default profile / real plugins store) is never restructured; only its
known_marketplaces.json is canonicalised to the ~/.claude prefix.

The same launch-time sync also mirrors `enabledPlugins` from ~/.claude/settings.json
into every profile's settings.json. Claude Code treats enabled plugin state as
config-dir-local, so sharing the cache is not enough: without this mirror, Kimi/GLM/etc.
see the files but silently don't load most skills.

ADOPTION (the write-back half of the mirror; added after the 2026-09-03 loss incident)
------------------------
`claude plugin install/enable` writes enabledPlugins keys into the ACTIVE profile's
settings.json only — main never learns the key, so the replace-style mirror above then
wipes it from every profile (and eventually from the active one too). Every "my skills
disappeared" report traced back to this. The sync therefore ADOPTS first: before
mirroring, each profile's enabledPlugins is scanned for keys main lacks; keys whose
value is consistent across profiles are written back into main's settings.json (atomic,
other keys preserved), then mirrored everywhere. Keys whose value CONFLICTS across
profiles are not adopted and are preserved per-profile until resolved manually —
never silently overwritten.

Usage:
    python3 claude-plugins-sync.py            # apply
    python3 claude-plugins-sync.py --dry-run  # preview

Run automatically by claude-profile() at init and launch. Safe to run any time.

Env overrides (match claude-profiles.sh):
    CLAUDE_BASE_DIR       default ~/.claude
    CLAUDE_PROFILES_DIR   default ~/.claude-profiles
