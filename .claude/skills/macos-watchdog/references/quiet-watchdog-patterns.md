# Quiet-Watchdog Patterns

Design patterns for the four contract clauses in SKILL.md, each with the sanitized war story that produced it. Every story is real; identifiers are generalized (the lesson transfers, the names don't).

## Pattern 1: Premise-state self-check

**Pattern.** First lines of every run: test the premise. Not holding → `exit 0` silently. The check must be *state*, not *schedule* — "I was told to run" is not evidence the job is still needed.

**War story.** A watcher existed to detect "config has switched back to main." The switch happened; the watcher kept firing every interval for 2 hours, sending 3 notifications that all asserted the switch had NOT happened — because the notification text was a fixed string written when the watcher was created, and nothing re-read the actual state. Fix: premise check at script start (`=main → self-stop, no notice`); notification text generated from the live state, never from a frozen template. The lifecycle of a monitor binds to its premise state — `launchctl disable` from a human is symptom relief, not the mechanism.

## Pattern 2: Patient mode

**Pattern.** Split *detection* from *disruption*. Detection runs honestly every cycle. The disruptive action (reconnect, restart, force-refresh) fires only after the dead state persists across N consecutive cycles, counted in a state file with a staleness window (a counter from before a sleep/wake gap doesn't count).

**Why.** The failure mode that trains people to ignore a watchdog is the false-positive *action*, not the false-positive *log line*. One measured chain oscillated: bad phases self-recovered in ≤3 minutes, and force-reconnect was never what fixed it — the chain recovered even right after the watchdog logged "all levels exhausted." Disruptive heal on a self-limiting blip is net-harmful: it force-drops connections that would have cleared themselves.

**Calibration.** Measure your system's self-recovery window first (run a passive sampler for a few hours — count how long bad phases actually last), then set N so N×interval comfortably exceeds the window. N=2 at 5-min interval for a ≤3-min window.

**Breadth is a second calibration, not a corollary of N.** When the trigger aggregates several independent sources into one verdict, the cross-source agreement fraction needs its own calibration pass — it is not automatically right just because N was calibrated. War story: a 9-source collection-health gate defaulted to requiring all 9 sources failing (the intuitive "obviously broken" bar); the real incident it existed to catch held steady at 6/9 failing on every check, so the all-or-nothing gate silently read "healthy" through the entire episode. Recalibrating against that same real incident data (not a hypothetical) to a ≥60%-of-sources-failing threshold caught it; three synthetic fixtures at 0%, 11%, and 100% failing then confirmed the new threshold still tolerated one lone flaky source without alerting.

## Pattern 3: Escalating auto-cooldown

**Pattern.** When the full remediation ladder fails, record an exhausted round and stand down for an escalating tier (e.g. 30 min → 2 h → 6 h). During cool-down: no probes, no remediation, no notifications, entry logged. On expiry: one retry round. Success clears the counter; failure advances the tier.

**War story.** A proxy-repair watchdog's ladder ended with `notify "all failed, needs human"` and **did not reset its dead counter**. Next cycle the counter still exceeded the patient threshold → full ladder again → notify again. On an unfixable network (real-IP reachable, domain path hijacked — a captive portal the watchdog cannot fix), this re-ran the entire ladder plus a chat notification every 5 minutes forever, each round re-launching the proxy app to the foreground. The user's report: "it keeps opening the app; I quit it and it comes back." `ThrottleInterval` cannot fix this — the job exits 0 every time; the spam is application-level, so the silence must be too.

**Implementation.** `scripts/watchdog-cooldown.sh` — source and wire three call sites: gate at entry (`paused_any`), record on ladder exhaustion (`record_exhausted`), clear on real heal (`clear_exhausted`). Manual `pause`/`resume` subcommands included as the human override.

## Pattern 4: Never resurrect a user-quit app

**Pattern.** Any remediation that invokes a GUI app (URL scheme, `open -a`, AppleScript activate) goes through a gate:

```bash
sr_open() {  # name yours after the target
    paused_any && return 1
    pgrep -x "$TARGET_PROCESS" >/dev/null 2>&1 || return 1   # user quit: do NOT relaunch
    open -g "$1"                                             # -g: never steal foreground
}
```

**Why both halves.** `open <url-scheme>` launches the app when it isn't running — the watchdog becomes the resurrector the user fights. And `open` without `-g` foregrounds the app even when it was already running, so every remediation cycle pops a window. Cleanup traps (`trap … EXIT`) that "ensure connected on abort" must pass the same gate — the trap fires exactly when the user may have just quit the app to make the loop stop.

## Pattern 5: Health checks certify only the plane they probe

**Pattern.** Enumerate the traffic planes your watchdog's service carries (proxied vs direct, read vs write, control vs data) and probe each one. "Healthy" must name the plane: `proxy-plane=ok direct-plane=dead`.

**War story.** A proxy watchdog probed only `google.com/generate_204` through the tunnel. The tunnel's domestic-direct forwarding plane broke for 2+ hours while the proxied plane stayed healthy — domestic domains all failed TLS while overseas traffic flowed. The watchdog logged "Proxy already healthy" through the entire outage. Second story, same shape: the chain intermittently *dropped* ~40-50% of connections instead of dying, so a single probe passed ~60% of the time during a real outage — fixed by N=8 samples requiring ≥6 successes per cycle. A green check certifies the path it probed, at the rate it probed, nothing more.

## Pattern 6: Batch loops throttle by default

**Pattern.** Any watchdog that spawns work in a loop (replays, fuzzing, batch scans, batch API calls) takes batch-size / interval / concurrency caps as first-class parameters with conservative defaults. Ask when writing the loop: "how many new processes/requests/files per second × how long will this run?"

**War story.** A perfectly correct hook-replay test ran with no throttle: fork 1,041/sec for 7 minutes, die temperature 83.1 °C, and a system policy daemon became the day's top CPU consumer from the fallout. The test logic was right; to the machine, an unthrottled loop and a fork bomb are the same thing. The inverse diagnostic habit too: when a machine runs hot, ask "is some test/batch running unthrottled?" before hunting runaway processes.

## Pattern 7: A green success log is not a health signal

**Pattern.** A job that prints its success line *only after every step succeeded* (the `set -e` shape) leaves no trace at all on a failed pass. So the freshness of its success log says nothing about the last pass — only that *some* pass succeeded recently. The health judgement has to come from the failure path: does an err.log / failure-state file / last-exit status exist, and does anything read it? `launchctl list` gives only the **last** exit code and a run count, never an exit-code history — that history lives in the log.

**War story.** A 300-second marketplace-sync daemon showed five simultaneous green signals — 4204 lines of `source-sync verified` at that moment, out.log mtime one minute old, `LastExitStatus=0`, plist on disk, job registered in `launchctl print` — while `source-sync.err.log` held 137 tracebacks from five distinct root causes. The failing passes wrote nothing whatsoever, so every freshness signal stayed green. What exposed it was counting the tracebacks, not reading the success log. (The log keeps growing on its 300-second beat, so read that count as a snapshot, not a constant.)
