# Skill Sanitization Checklist

When extracting a skill from a business project for public distribution, remove private business-specific content while preserving reusable behavior and verified public examples.

## Step 0: decide the destination — this checklist may not apply at all

Everything in this file describes what goes wrong when a skill reaches people who are not
the author. **A skill living in the author's own private repo is a different artifact with a
different failure mode**, and running this checklist against it does damage:

| | Public destination | Private destination |
|---|---|---|
| A real absolute path | breaks on every other machine | **is why the script runs** |
| A pre-filled credential / entity in a template | leak | saves the next run from re-filling it |
| A real project name in an example | leak | the example everyone there recognizes |
| Correct action | sanitize | **report, and let the owner decide** |

How to tell: `gh repo view --json isPrivate` on the repo the skill lives in. `quick_validate`
does this automatically and prints a `🔒 audience: private` note when it applies; pass
`--audience=public` to force the strict pass when preparing a private skill for release.

**Why this matters more than it looks.** A checker that flags healthy input teaches people to
ignore it. The research is unambiguous: ~90% of developers accept a false-positive rate up to
5%, only 24% tolerate 20%, and developers actively **prefer tools that find fewer real bugs
over tools that cry wolf** — false positives are the dominant barrier to static-analysis
adoption ([Chou, *False Positives Over Time*](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/BugWorkshop05/papers/34-chou.pdf);
[Why do or why don't developers use static analysis tools](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-4077/paper17.pdf)).
Sanitizing a private skill's working paths is exactly that failure: the owner learns the
checker costs them a working tool, and turns it off everywhere — including on the public
skill where it was the only thing standing between them and a real leak.

**Real incident (2026-07-19):** a validator warning about an absolute path in a *private*
skill was read as a defect. The path was replaced with `<project-root>/合同/<合同名>` and the
script stopped running. The same pass rewrote a hardcoded assertion "to make it reusable" and
silently dropped one branch of an `or`, so a case that used to pass began failing. The owner's
words: 「这是我的私人仓库啊，按照我们已有的规则，不要管它，不然的话你反而去影响我自己的正常使用。」
Everything was reverted. The warning had never said to fix it — it said `Skill is valid!` —
the escalation from *warning* to *work order* was the whole error.

## The rule that matters most: read it yourself, don't just grep

Scanners — gitleaks, the grep patterns below, `security_scan.py` — only match what you **thought to list**: known secret formats, a name list you wrote, specific path shapes. They are blind to the most dangerous leak of all: **real content with no proper noun to catch.** A verbatim spoken line from a real transcript (a casual aside with no name in it), a specific real-world example dropped into an illustration, a real meeting or project mentioned in passing, a codename you simply forgot to add to the word list — none of these have a keyword for grep to hit, so every scanner sails right past them.

The primary sanitization method is therefore **you reading the entire skill** — SKILL.md, every reference file, every example, every bundled doc — and judging each concrete noun, example, and snippet semantically:

> "Does this read like a generic placeholder or a public entity (Claude, GitHub, LangChain, `<project>`), or like it was lifted from a real project / person / transcript?"

Private material in the second category gets replaced unless explicitly approved
for this public use — **even if no scanner flagged it.**

**"grep returned no matches" is not a clean bill of health.** It only means the word list you guessed didn't fire. Run the scanners below as a cheap first pass for the obvious stuff, then do the read-through as the actual gate. If you only do one, do the read-through.

### Trace examples and verify required helpers

Before adding or changing a concrete example, identifier, quotation or incident
fragment, identify its source: a verifiable public source, an invented example,
or private work. Keep source locators and replacement decisions in the existing
private review artifact; do not ship private logs or their identifiers as provenance.
Check session/rollout IDs and operational details even when they contain no name
or secret signature. Renaming a service does not sanitize a description that still
reveals its private architecture or incident.

Retain public facts and examples explicitly approved for public use within that
approval's scope. When a source cannot be established, use a clearly synthetic
equivalent that preserves the command, failure mechanism or teaching point.
Do not present the replacement as an observed incident or force a user decision
when an equivalent invented example resolves the uncertainty.

For each helper required by the changed instructions, verify how the public
reader obtains it. Inspect a bundled helper in the actual distributed file set;
for a separately maintained dependency, follow its declared installation path
and verify a representative operation within existing authorization. Keep its
update owner, as defined in SKILL.md's Complementary Skills contract. A helper on
the author's machine is not a distributed dependency. Replacing an absolute path
with `~/` fixes the path shape, not the helper's availability. Mark unavailable
runtime evidence as unverified rather than claiming the command works.

The author performs these checks, and the required independent pass reviews their
evidence using [the public-distribution axes](independent-review-protocol.md#public-distribution-axes).
Scanners and release receipts do not enforce these semantic judgments.

## Quick Scan Commands

Run these grep patterns to identify potential sensitive content:

```bash
# Business/product names (case-insensitive)
grep -rniE "acme|globex|[company-name]|[product-name]" skill-folder/

# Person names (look for capitalized names)
grep -rniE "\b(Carol|John|Alice|Bob|小华|小明)\b" skill-folder/

# Absolute paths and usernames
grep -rniE "/Users/|/home/|/mnt/c/Users|OneDrive|username" skill-folder/

# Chinese characters (if skill should be English-only)
grep -rn '[一-龥]' skill-folder/

# Internal jargon
grep -rniE "ultrathink|internal-only|confidential" skill-folder/
```

> **Pattern-based detectors match the SHAPE, not the value — a replacement that keeps the shape is not sanitized (2026-09-19).** Rewriting a real home path to a placeholder username like `example` reads as "placeholder now" to the eye, but the repo's gitleaks rule is `/Users/[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/` — **any username matches, including `example`**; CI's secret scan stayed red until every path became `~/`-relative. The grep on line 64 above flags the same shape, so it would have caught this — the failure was trusting the eye over the scanner. **Rule: after replacing, re-run the real detector or verify against its actual pattern in the config; never judge sanitization by whether the value "looks like a placeholder."** (Corollary: absolute user paths in a public skill should become `~/`-relative — the relative form is both correct and detector-proof. And a meta-lesson from writing this very block: **the detector cannot tell a quoted instance from a leaked one** — the first draft of this paragraph quoted both literals and the repo's own commit guard blocked the commit; that is why the rule quotes the regex, never an instance.)

## Categories to Sanitize

### 1. Product and Project Names

**What to find:**
- Project codenames (e.g., "Acme Prepared", "Project Phoenix")
- Internal product names (e.g., "Ops Console", "Admin Dashboard")
- Tool-specific names (e.g., "Globex Gemini" → just "Gemini")
- **CJK project/instance nicknames** (e.g., real pet-names for your own instances). gitleaks ignores CJK entirely, and the person-name grep above only lists a few given names — a Chinese project nickname sprinkled through your examples sails past every scanner.

> **War-story (2026-06-28):** the `openclaw` skill used two real private instance nicknames as examples in 13+ places across SKILL.md and an architecture doc. `security_scan` was green, gitleaks found nothing, every grep pattern missed them — they were caught only by reading the file and recognizing the names as a real project, then replaced with generic placeholders. **A green scan on a config / personal-workflow skill is exactly when to slow down and read every example noun**, because those skills are built around your own real instances.

**How to replace:**
- Use generic terms: "the system", "the application", "the service"
- Use placeholder patterns: `<project-name>`, `<product-name>`
- Use generic examples: "e-commerce platform", "user management system"

### 2. Person Names

**What to find:**
- Real employee names in examples: "Carol will handle...", "小华你来..."
- Team member references in action items
- Author attributions that reveal identity

**How to replace:**
- Private incident cases are not exempt: preserve the mechanics and failure shape, but replace private identities with invented names. Keep verified public attributions or identities explicitly approved for this publication. Check invented names against the actual team roster so the fiction does not accidentally identify a colleague.
- Use generic names: "Alice", "Bob", "the developer", "the reviewer"
- Use role-based references: "Backend team", "PM", "Designer"
- Remove author attributions or use placeholders

### 3. Entity and Data Model Names

**What to find:**
- Business-specific entities: `REVIEW_RESULT`, `RISK_MODEL`, `INSPECTION_FACTOR`
- Domain-specific hierarchies: `Section → Area → Item → Evidence`
- Field names revealing business logic: `risk_level`, `underwriting_status`

**How to replace:**
- Use generic entities: `ORDER`, `ORDER_ITEM`, `USER`, `PRODUCT`
- Use generic hierarchies: `Category → Subcategory → Item → Detail`
- Use generic fields: `status`, `quantity`, `customer_name`

### 4. Folder Structures and Paths

**What to find:**
- Team-specific folders: `10-team-collaboration/Meeting Minutes`
- Project-specific paths: `ops-console-api-design`
- Environment-specific paths: user home directory project paths

**How to replace:**
- Use generic paths: `project-docs/meeting-minutes`
- Use placeholder paths: `<project-root>/docs/`
- Use relative paths within skill bundle

### 5. Internal Terminology and Jargon

**What to find:**
- Internal slang: "ultrathink", "deep dive session"
- Company-specific processes: "Acme standup", "Portal review"
- Abbreviations without context: "MP", "RP", "UW"

**How to replace:**
- Use industry-standard terms: "deep review", "thorough analysis"
- Expand or remove unexplained abbreviations
- Use generic process names

### 6. Language-Specific Content

**What to find:**
- Chinese phrases in English skills: "后面再说", "MVP 先不做"
- Mixed language examples that assume bilingual context
- Culture-specific references

**How to replace:**
- Translate to the skill's primary language
- Use language-neutral examples
- Or explicitly support multilingual with clear labels

### 7. Business Logic Examples

**What to find:**
- Domain-specific workflows: "Underwriting system conflicts"
- Business rules: "Inspection Factor vs Risk Factor"
- Industry-specific terminology without explanation

**How to replace:**
- Use generic software examples: "Note field conflicts with Comment system"
- Use universal patterns: "UserProfile vs Account naming conflict"
- Add context if domain terms are necessary

### 8. External Service References

**What to find:**
- Internal APIs: `POST /evaluate (push to Risk Model)`
- Company-specific integrations: "Sync with Underwriting system"
- Internal tool names: "Globex search", "Internal Wiki"

**How to replace:**
- Use generic services: `POST /process (send to External Service)`
- Use placeholder APIs: `<external-api>/endpoint`
- Use generic tool categories: "enterprise search", "knowledge base"

## Sanitization Process

### Phase 1: Automated Scan

```bash
# Run all grep patterns above
# Export results to a file for review
grep -rniE "pattern1|pattern2|pattern3" skill-folder/ > sanitization_report.txt
```

### Phase 2: Manual Review

For each changed example and scan match, apply the source and helper checks above:
1. Determine if it's truly business-specific or generic
2. Decide on appropriate replacement
3. Check if replacement maintains meaning
4. Verify no broken references

### Phase 3: Verification (the read-through is the real gate)

After sanitization:
1. **Read the whole skill again yourself** — SKILL.md + every reference + every example — re-asking the semantic question above on each concrete noun and snippet. This is what catches the no-keyword leaks (a verbatim transcript line, a real spoken example) that scanners structurally cannot see. **This step, not the grep, is what "passes" sanitization.**
2. Re-run the grep patterns + `security_scan.py` as a secondary check — but read "no matches" as "the obvious stuff is gone", never as "it's clean"
3. Test skill functionality still works through the distributed helpers or declared dependencies (no broken references after replacements)
4. If you can, have a fresh reader — a person, or a subagent with no prior context — read it cold; fresh eyes catch what you've already read past

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Over-sanitizing generic terms | "reviewer" as a role is fine; "Ops Console" is not |
| Breaking examples by removing context | Replace with equivalent generic examples |
| Leaving orphaned references | Check all cross-references after renaming |
| Inconsistent replacements | Use find-and-replace for consistency |
| Sanitizing technical terms | Keep industry-standard terms (API, JSON, MVP) |
