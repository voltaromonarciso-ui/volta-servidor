"""
People roster loader — derive person-name ASR corrections from a markdown roster.

Reads a people-roster markdown file (the one `people_roster_path` points at) and extracts
{asr_variant: canonical_name} pairs so transcript-fixer can auto-correct recurring
person-name ASR errors without a per-name manual dictionary entry.

Roster format (the SSOT the human maintains):
    ### <Canonical Name>
    - **身份**: ...
    - **ASR 变体**: variant1, variant2, variant3   <- each maps -> Canonical Name
    - **别名**: ...                                  <- IGNORED (valid aliases, not errors)
    - **易混**: ...                                  <- IGNORED (prose notes; often too risky
                                                       to auto-correct, e.g. 李老师→黎老师)

Only `###` sections with an `ASR 变体` line contribute *corrections*. The canonical
name is the `### ` header — it MUST be clean (no parenthetical aliases; those belong
in `别名`).

A `###` section with no variant line still registers the person: `load_roster_names`
reads every header, and `--lookup` reports those hits, so "this name is in the roster,
it is not an ASR error" is answerable for someone who has never been misheard. Without
that, a roster entry carrying only `身份` is indistinguishable from an unknown string —
which is the state that lets a real name get collapsed onto a phonetic neighbour.

The derived corrections are merged into Stage 1 at runtime (in-memory only, NEVER
written to the DB) and go through the normal risk gate: long variants auto-apply;
short/common ones surface in *_needs_review.md for confirmation against the roster
context — so the curated roster feeds the system without bypassing safety.

Two semantic refusals live at load time. A **bare numeric variant** (a number heard
as a person, e.g. `95` -> someone) can never be a global rule, because digits match
timestamps, scores, and prices in every transcript — deferring it for review just
converts the mistake into queue spam (real case 2026-09: one roster line deferred
122 items across five files in a single rerun, most of them `.950` millisecond
timestamps). A **single surname plus an honorific** (朱老师, 王总) is refused for
the mirror reason: it names everyone with that surname, so one person's misheard
surname must not become a rule for all of them (real case 2026-09-07). Both are
refused with a loud stderr warning; record such a mapping as a cue-scoped trap in
the owning domain's context file instead.
