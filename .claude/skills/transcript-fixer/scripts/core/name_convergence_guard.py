"""Name-convergence guard: fail-closed gate against collapsing a person name
onto a phonetic neighbour whose target form nothing in the library claims.

Real incident 2026-09-16: an agent normalized 乙琳→乙林 and 丙盛→丙胜 by
transcript-majority spelling; both targets were wrong (the group-chat
displayName said so afterwards), and the error reached a pushed commit before
anyone re-read the roster. triage / accept / --add all ran on agent
discretion, and discretion is exactly what failed. This module is the
mechanical gate that discretion used to be: it fires at the two write points
(`--resolve-review --decision accepted|overridden`, and `--add` when the new
mapping is person-name shaped) and refuses the write when the target is
either someone else's recorded ASR variant or a string no store knows.

The gate asks four questions, in order, first hit decides:

a. Is the target a roster entry name (### header) or the to_text of an ACTIVE
   dictionary rule?  -> PASS: the form is already claimed as somebody's
   canonical form; converging onto a claimed form is the normal correction.
b. Is the target ONLY someone's roster ASR variant?  -> REJECT, naming the
   canonical: a variant is a recorded mishearing, so rewriting text onto it
   manufactures the error the roster exists to fix.
c. Is the target found NOWHERE (dictionary / roster / context rules / review
   queue, --lookup semantics) AND the evidence names no authority source?
   -> REJECT: majority-spelling convergence onto an unclaimed string is the
   incident shape verbatim. The remediation is written into the message:
   enqueue kind:entity, or name the authority (roster line / group
   displayName+nickName double-read / user ruling / audio evidence).
d. Otherwise (target claimed somewhere, or evidence names an authority)
   -> PASS.

Everything the guard needs to know about the library arrives through the
injected ``lookup_fn`` so the decision logic stays pure and unit-testable;
the CLI wires the production lookup (dictionary + roster + context rules +
review queue).

# Naming an authority class is not the same as HAVING it. 「需名册确认」
# 「需听该段音频」「待用户裁定」 cite the class while saying it was never
# obtained — 2026-09-20 audit of the live queue: 46 gated rows passed branch
# (d), a majority of them on exactly this shape (#746「需名册/音频确认
# canonical」, #950「需听该段音频」, #945「需耳核/用户裁定」).
#
# The criterion has to answer "what counts as unobtained", not "how short is the
# gap". The first version measured a fixed 6-character window in front of each
# authority noun; that width was arbitrary, and the hole it left defeated the
# gate's whole reason to exist: 「需要先去听完整的那一段音频再判断」 (marker 11
# characters away) and 「pending roster confirmation」 (English — no Chinese
# marker at all) both passed, i.e. the 2026-09-16 majority-spelling shape
# survived the fix whenever the connector got a little longer or changed
# language. Measured on the incident pair with an all-False lookup:
#
#   需名册确认                      -> refused  (correct)
#   需先与用户当面确认群昵称          -> PASSED   (9 chars away)
#   需要先去听完整的那一段音频再判断   -> PASSED   (11 chars away)
#   pending roster confirmation     -> PASSED   (English, no marker)
#   TBD 群昵称 double-read          -> PASSED   (English, no marker)
#   待用户裁定 roster 行 ### 王晓明   -> refused  (false refusal: that roster
#                                       citation WAS obtained)
#
# So: split the evidence into clauses on sentence punctuation, and inside a
# clause a need-marker governs the noun phrase it is attached to. The governed
# phrase ends at the clause end, or at the first whitespace that CLOSES an
# authority noun — once 「用户裁定」 or 「roster」 has been cited in full, a
# whitespace-separated segment after it is a fresh citation the marker does not
# reach (that is what keeps 「待用户裁定 roster 行 ### 王晓明」 obtained). A
# marker that FOLLOWS a noun governs it too (「名册需确认」), so the question is
# "is any authority noun ungoverned", not "how far away is the marker".
#
# The remaining hole is the mirror image of that boundary rule: when the marker
# comes AFTER the noun and nothing but a citation-closing whitespace sits
# between them, the boundary severed the pair and the noun was left ungoverned:
#
#   roster 需确认              -> PASSED   (should be refused)
#   dashboard 听音待核         -> PASSED   (should be refused)
#   群昵称 TBD                 -> PASSED   (should be refused)
#
# while the same shape in Chinese (「名册需确认」, no whitespace inside the noun)
# was refused correctly. So a marker that the boundary rule leaves reaching NO
# noun governs every noun in the clause. It could not be the plainer "each
# marker governs the nearest noun on either side": 「用户裁定：需先听音频确认」
# has 需 three characters from 音频 but five from 用户裁定, and nearest-only
# would leave 用户裁定 ungoverned and let that pending ruling pass — the
# colon is not a boundary, and the marker governs both sides across it. The
# fallback only ever turns a pass into a refusal, never the reverse.

# Sentence punctuation ends a claim. So does a comma: 「疑此人，需名册确认」 is
# one pending citation, and 「需名册确认，roster 行 ### 王晓明」 carries an
# obtained one beside it — the module's standing rule is that any single
# unobstructed citation is enough. A colon deliberately does NOT end a claim:
# 「用户裁定：需先听音频确认」 is still pending.
