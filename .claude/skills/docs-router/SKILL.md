  Routes docs: Word/PDF/PPTX/saved HTML→Markdown; MD/Word→PDF; create Word; PDF
  HTML/translate; Excel/xlsm/macOS; photo/signed scans; Mermaid; DOCX review;
  post-change docs. Reads one bundled Daymade specialist. New slide decks use
  deck-creator when installed; generic PDF reading/editing and spreadsheet
  analysis stay with their own Skills. Retired ppt-creator stays manual-only.

# Daymade document router

Choose the one specialist that owns the requested result. First find the path
of **this loaded** `docs-router/SKILL.md` in the active skill catalog or the
invocation that opened it. Resolve that path to its canonical location (follow
symlinks), verify that it exists under a `docs-router` directory, and take that
directory's parent as the suite root. The paths in the table are relative to
this router's directory; resolve the selected path and verify that it points
to a direct sibling `SKILL.md` inside that suite root. Never anchor resolution
to the task's working directory or an old installed copy. Claude Code may
expand `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` as a shortcut, but the router must work when
that variable is absent, as in Codex. If this router's own active path cannot
be identified unambiguously, stop instead of guessing a copy.

Read the selected child `SKILL.md` **in full** before acting; if a read is
truncated, continue from the omitted part. Then load every reference that the
child requires for this branch of work. The leaf skills are intentionally
absent from automatic discovery, so open their files directly rather than
invoking them through the Skill tool. A user can still invoke any leaf's
original `/daymade-docs:<leaf>` command manually.

| Requested result | Read this exact file |
|---|---|
| Convert a DOCX, PDF, PPTX, or saved HTML/HTM to Markdown; parse Word or extract document text and images into Markdown | `../doc-to-markdown/SKILL.md` |
| Turn Markdown into a printable PDF | `../pdf-creator/SKILL.md` |
| Create or format a Word `.docx`; export or repair an **existing Word/WPS manuscript** as PDF | `../docx-creator/SKILL.md` |
| Turn a PDF into a self-contained, image-faithful HTML reading page, optionally translating it while keeping figures and charts | `../pdf-to-html/SKILL.md` |
| Extract Mermaid diagrams from Markdown or render Mermaid as PNG | `../mermaid-tools/SKILL.md` |
| Create a professionally formatted Excel workbook, parse a complex investment-bank `.xlsm` model, or control Excel on macOS | `../excel-automation/SKILL.md` |
| Turn photos of paper pages into a scanned PDF, replace pages in a scan, or make an unsigned digital document look hand-signed and scanned | `../photo-to-scanned-pdf/SKILL.md` |
| Extract Word/WPS DOCX comments or tracked changes into a review ledger | `../read-docx-review/SKILL.md` |
| Check documentation impact after an authorized code, script, config, environment, path, deployment, auth, test, or procedure change; or consolidate redundant docs | `../docs-cleaner/SKILL.md` |

Decide by the **input and requested output**, not a shared word such as “PDF”
or “document.” For example, Markdown → PDF selects `pdf-creator`; an existing
Word manuscript → PDF selects `docx-creator`; PDF → Markdown selects
`doc-to-markdown`; PDF → HTML selects `pdf-to-html`. If the request spans two
results, read each relevant child before its stage.

For website → Markdown, acquire the authorized pages through the owning web
workflow first, then select `doc-to-markdown` for the saved HTML. That conversion
branch does not crawl a site or certify presentation in a recipient's reader.

Do not select a Daymade child for a new slide deck or generic PPT work. Use
`deck-creator` for new presentation creation only when it is installed. If it
is unavailable, this suite has no automatic current PPT builder; external
users may explicitly invoke the retired `/daymade-docs:ppt-creator` for
compatibility. General PDF reading/editing,
ordinary spreadsheet analysis, and other tasks without a matching row remain
with their owning skills or normal workflow. If the result is unclear, inspect
the actual file/task or ask for the missing input or output; do not guess a
Daymade child from an extension alone.

After an authorized code, script, config, environment, path, deployment, auth,
test, or procedure change, select `docs-cleaner` for a scoped documentation
impact check even if the user did not mention docs. Read its full instructions
at that stage; do not replace the primary task's specialist or scan unrelated
documentation. Explicit documentation impact and cleanup requests also route
there. A read-only investigation does not acquire write authorization through
this router.
