// Dynamic Workflow: 6-dimension health check for a Claude Code skills marketplace repo.
//
// HOW TO RUN (see SKILL.md): Read this file, then launch it with the Workflow tool via the
// `script` parameter (inline) so there is no path-resolution dependency on the installed
// skill location. Pass a pre-run scout result as args for accurate per-agent context:
//
//   Workflow({ script: <contents of this file>, args: { repo: "owner/name", scale: "<one-liner>" } })
//
// args is OPTIONAL — if omitted, each inspector self-discovers the repo scale first.
// This is READ-ONLY: inspectors must not modify files, comment on PRs/issues, or push.
